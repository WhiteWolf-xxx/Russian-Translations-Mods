Odd. This pearl seems to have been sealed up with a talisman.<LINE>I'll remove it so we can read the full thing:

"Cycle of the 801st Sun.<LINE>Despite my attempts to keep them calm, several of the workers in the pipeline sector of the boiler remain uneasy.<LINE>Any more cycles like this, and I fear it may impact their performances on the job<LINE>(and, therefore, my performance in the eyes of my higher ups.)"

"Word has been spreading recently of a number of mysterious phenomena occurring at the site."

"One report described a small creature that could swim through the air, and, supposedly, straight through solid walls."

"Strange as this may sound (as I have never seen such a creature with my own eyes,)<LINE>it is not the main source of panic among my crew."

"I've been digging around in the archives, and I believe I've found a file that describes a similar situation to what is being reported now.<LINE> It was written by a worker who has long since left the construction site, but the resemblances in this report are eerie, to say the least.<LINE>It reads as follows:"

'Cycle of the 653rd Sun.<LINE>Emergency call received.<LINE>Several workers have collapsed: some dead, others barely responsive.'

'There appear to be signs of memory contamination in those interviewed following the incident.<LINE>Several workers have given an identical report on an event that (we can prove) never happened in the boiler, but that they claim was real.'

'This One will interview the dead upon their return to our world, but the event has left many shaken.<LINE>Rumors have begun to spread of not just contamination, but also of complete memory loss.<LINE>Such a prospect is frightening to think about.'

'This One will continue to investigate-'

"And that is the end of the report."

"At the time this report was written, the workers couldn't determine a cause for the mass memory contamination."

"...I, however, believe I've discovered something that the report missed."

"During the Cycle of the 653rd Sun, the heat had been raised drastically to burn away a certain organic compound found in many of the lower pipes.<LINE>Following this, and following the contamination event, the workers continued to do their jobs as if nothing had gone wrong.<LINE>The cabinets were shipped out to customers, and all seemed to be going smoothly from then on..."

"...until upon a certain delivery, it was discovered that one of the creatures inside the cabinets had gone missing."
