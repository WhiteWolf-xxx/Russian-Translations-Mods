Here I stand, sinking into the deep tides of history.

I thought at first I could see it all, every <LINE> little wave and propagation of future voices.

But as the centuries have passed, I have come to <LINE> realize the grandiose scale of the future.

A million ripples fan out from the present, <LINE> into an endless web of futures.

How large will your waves be, small one?

Will your name flood the annals of history <LINE> for time eternal?

Or will you sink into the depths of obscurity like myself?

We'll see what your random fate has in store...
