It was a fool of me to assume there was a deeper meaning to<LINE>my continued resignment to these plains.
 
But as I've witnessed the curtains of frost fall and rise from this land,<LINE>the truth becomes all the more simple.

The bond between our bodies and the physical world is one<LINE>we should have never forsaken. I yearn for the gentle sway<LINE>of grass and the feeling of sun on my skin.

That yearning is what keeps me trapped here.

Is it a sin to simply experience the world around us with fondness?<LINE>Instead, I now must witness my nostalgic surroundings<LINE>rendered dank and unrecognizable by the cruel hands of time.

If only I was allowed to live out my full life how I wanted,<LINE>and let those fulfilled dreams rest within the void,<LINE>instead of cutting it short.

Now these yearnings will haunt me as I bear the curse of the infinite.
