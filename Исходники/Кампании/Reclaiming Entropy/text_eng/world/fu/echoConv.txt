Ah, rejoice, little creature! Join me as new life blossoms<LINE>from this sacred world they dared to call cruel!Isn't it beautiful? The infinite unpredictabilities of life?<LINE>Every moment, I feel giddy with wonder, watching nature<LINE>transform our discarded creations into something more.I envy you, dear traveler, for your flesh is real and vibrant.Tell me, what do the vines read, in their creeping language of twists and bumps?<LINE>What songs from the chorus of peciliar creatures do you hear echoing throughout this great jungle?Although my senses are limited, I know one thing's for sure.<LINE>This cozy cave is growing smaller by each cycle!~
