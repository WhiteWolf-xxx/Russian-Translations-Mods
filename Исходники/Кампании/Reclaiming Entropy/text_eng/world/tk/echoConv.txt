Another pathetic beast has reached me.<LINE>Another pointless set of ears to recieve my ancient memories.<LINE>Another moving part in this endless machine.

A little green thing of your kind gave me a brief hope that this great mechanism will finally come to a halt.

But as it turns out, that little green mechanic only sought to halt our own machines.<LINE>Our random gods, who now seem just as simple as a light switch in comparison to the unfathomable machinations of time.

This eternity is the same as the last, and it will be just as similar as the next.<LINE>The infinite movements of time remain forever unfazed by even our greatest consturctions.<LINE>We've far since surpassed the point of wishing for an escape from the clockwork waltz of existence.<LINE>All we can do now is make like a cog and dance.
