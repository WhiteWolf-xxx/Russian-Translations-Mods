///AQ_BEACH2
Your children are also your comrades in your expedition.
They are less clumsy and more capable than other pups, but you can still carry them if you fear they won't be able to keep up.
///AQ_BEACH1
It is highly recommended to take the upper path in the next room, which continues the tutorial.
///AQ_TUTORIAL1
Click on your young or their food indicator to select them. Then press the jump button to direct them to the location of the cursor.
They will stay at that location even if you move to a different room, and defend their position to the best of their ability.
///AQ_TUTORIAL2
To direct one of your young to follow you or to cancel an order, click on them (or their food indicator) and double-tap either jump, throw, or grab.
Pressing the map and jump button at once will also recall your entire family, should you have multiple children staying at different points.
///AQ_TUTORIAL3
You can also press the throw button after selecting a pup to attack any creature at the location of the cursor.
They will pursue the target and attempt to kill them to the best of their ability.
However, the strength of your family is in numbers.
Press the map and throw button at once and all of your children will attack the creature at the location of your cursor.
Recalling or cancelling attack orders works the same as how movement orders work.
///AQ_TUTORIAL4
Select a pup and press the grab button to direct them to retrieve the item at the location of your cursor. They will then bring that item back to you.
If you double-pressed grab instead, and the object at the location of your cursor was edible, they would eat it as soon as they reached its location.
Your pups will also grab and consume any food they directly encounter when following you or being carried, but this option can be toggled off in remix settings.
