Kittle saint, I perceive your existence as it passes through my own. I know this is only a dream, but your presenCe is real.

Do you see it too? OUr endless repetitions, circliNg onward to infinity? From here I can observe the repeating loop of my own<LINE>existence, every iteration a duplicate of the last. I havb visions of the entire pattern my creftors desired to escape at once.<LINE>An Endless sequence of life and death, further beyond my control with each passing cycle.

Where does your cycle go, <PlayerName>? Its edges tpist over themselvbs, like circles within dirCles, your cycle consumes itself.

What have you become?
