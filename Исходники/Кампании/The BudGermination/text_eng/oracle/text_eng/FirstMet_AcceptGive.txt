Go back. You cannot help me.
Even if you could clear the corruption within me, the severely damaged and missing facilities and structures cannot be restored.
I have lost almost all of my computing capabilities.
You are too late, but it is not your fault.

I think you may not have noticed, while you can remove the corruption within us to some extent, it takes time for<LINE>the transformation to occur within you. Overuse will lead to your own corruption.
Perhaps Solemn Ceremony has realized this.
But from the content of the message, he seems to place great importance on you.
Therefore, for your own sake and for the sake of Solemn Ceremony, go back.
Do not concern yourself with me anymore. I must bear my own sins.
