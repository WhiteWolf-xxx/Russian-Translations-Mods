If you really want to help me.
Listen, hairy creature on the ground, I cannot continue my work, and you do not have the ability to repair my facilities.<LINE>All you can do is alleviate my pain and collapse.
But that is not what Solemn Ceremony wants.
He sent you here only to assist me in my work, not to ease my death.
So you should go back to your master and never come back again.
