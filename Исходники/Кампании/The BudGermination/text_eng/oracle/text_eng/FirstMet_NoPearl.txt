Astounding.
What is the purpose of your crossing through countless dangers to reach me? As you can see, my facilities are severely corrupted,<LINE> and I no longer have the ability to bestow upon you.
Although I hardly receive messages from the overseers any more, they seem to be watching you more frequently. <LINE>The images conveyed from the monitors suggest that you didn't come here to escape the cycle.
It seems that you're carrying some sort of medium for information transmission, but you seem to have lost it now.
Without it, I can't obtain any relevant information. I can't rely solely on a foolish beast to convey this message.
If that information is indeed important, please retrieve it. Otherwise, please never come back again.
Now, leave. There's nothing left here to stay for.
