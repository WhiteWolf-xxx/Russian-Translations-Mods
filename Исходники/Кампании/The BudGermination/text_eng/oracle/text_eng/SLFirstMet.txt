Oh. Hello there!|0|80
What a strange specimen you are! My memory does not serve me well, but maybe I've never seen a creature like you?
I wonder who it is that gave you that mark? It could not have been my neighbor Five Pebbles, because he's in a very bad way.
These frequent downpours suggest to me an acute failure in his machinery, and in that condition, I doubt any creature could<LINE> get anywhere near him and still make it back alive.
Then are you from a far away land? Why did you come all the way here?
There is nothing for you here. I can only advise you to return to wherever you have come from. These lands have<LINE>become a tremendous hazard, and conditions will only worsen with the passage of time.
I hope you understand, little friend. I don't mean to be discourteous... I am simply fearing for your safety.
