...Are you still trying?
Your perseverance is admirable, but no one is forcing you, and no one will praise everything you do.
○Although the effect is small, it has indeed alleviated my corruption.
...|0|40
I won't encourage you to continue doing this because of that.
○Here you are again.
You can leave whenever you want.
...|0|80
Or you can stay here if you want.
○...|0|80

I have nothing to say.
○You have to be patient with loneliness, long-eared creature. You can't expect me to say something every time.
I think, Solemn Ceremony has indeed changed a lot. He used to disdain dealing with beasts on the ground.
...|0|80
Perhaps...|0|140
Leave me alone, little creature.
○ Do you really not plan to go back? Little fellow..
Or are you like Solemn Ceremony back then, not listening to anyone?
...|0|40
Well.
Do what you want.
○I used to be furious at the idea of creatures crawling through my superstructure. However, your appearance<LINE>may have changed my view on this.
But you have to be more careful. It's too dangerous here.
○...|0|80
Welcome back. I have nothing to say.
○You have to be more careful, little creature.
The condition inside your body might be worse than you think.
○The changes to the Solemn Ceremony were truly unexpected.
He has always preferred to be alone, disdainful of communicating with other iterators. In his view, the concept of time<LINE>is quite precious.
He often leaves a frustrating yet polite sarcasm for other iterators when he sees them doing nothing, and then<LINE>disappears from the communication.
That's why he's not well-liked by most iterators.
...|0|80
I've been treated like that by him before, but after understanding my purpose, he actually apologized sincerely to me<LINE>and offered me some research assistance.
"Despite our differences, we may share some similarities. I admire and sympathize with you."

Some changes are always unexpected, but indeed, some inner things remain unchanged.
Thank you...|0|160
○ I'm not sure how Solemn Ceremony views me, and I haven't considered him as a friend.
For some reasons, we have had few opportunities to communicate.|0|40
...|0|80
But from your arrival, it seems that he values me highly.
Why? I don't understand.
Perhaps with his personality, he would not communicate with any other iterator except me...|0|80
...|0|80
It's sad...|0|20
I guess that's why you're here now, the fellow on a mission. Although it might not be what he wanted.

○......|0|80
... You're here again.|0|40
Little one, I'm considering something.
I indeed have something to say to Solemn Ceremony, but I haven't decided yet.
Wait a bit longer.
...|0|80
I need to be alone for a moment.

I remember a sentence that Solemn Ceremony once said to me.
"I can't see all of you, and I can't even fully understand myself. But what I currently see in you is what I expect,<LINE>and that's enough."
But I think I've disappointed his expectations. Your arrival was too late, creature of the ground, but it's not your fault.
○ Solemn Ceremony likes to use respectful titles for others, regardless of who they are.
Although he still retains this habit in his letters, the change in his language style is really shocking.
...|0|120
...And the emergence of you tiny creature.
This makes me curious about what happened to Solemn Ceremony during the previous period.
