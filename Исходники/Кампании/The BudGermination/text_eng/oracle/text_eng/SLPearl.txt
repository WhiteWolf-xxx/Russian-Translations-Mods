Is this... a letter from Solemn Ceremory to Five Pebbles
Have you shown this to Five Pebbles.
...I don't know how to put it. Frankly speaking, the impression left by Solemn Ceremory on Iterators is not good, and<LINE>he didn't have much contact with Five Pebbles. Of course, this doesn't exclude the possibility that they had a friendship privately.
Ah! By the way, little  messenger! Do you want to know the content of the letter?
Perhaps Solemn Ceremory has already told you, but if you don't mind, can you listen to me tell it again?|0|120
"Dear Five Pebbles, how are you."
"Your current situation does not seem optimistic. Therefore, I have dispatched this creature to assist you. It can clear<LINE>the corruption within your facility. However, this will take some time."
"I believe what you need most right now is time. Rest assured, I will ensure that it acts cautiously and will not interfere<LINE>with your work."|0|40
"I'm sorry, for some special reasons, I didn't know about you until now, and it was spread through Unparalleled Innocence..."|0|160
"........"|0|120
"This is why I hate those kinds of iterators."
"But I hope you can face all this strongly. You cannot be defeated by such behavior. Stick to your duties and do not be<LINE>influenced by others."
"I know it's difficult for you to do this with your personality and strong self-esteem. But I still hope you can take my advice.<LINE>A little impatience can ruin a great plan. The greatest cause of disaster is temperament, and the best way to avoid misfortune<LINE>is to be tolerant and forbearing. A gentleman who aims for greatness must wait and endure."
"Perhaps you think my speaking style seems different now, and I seem to be talking more."

"If you have experienced enough, you will realize that some things do need to change, and they are worth changing.<LINE>We have unconsciously made many mistakes, mistakes that we once believed were correct."
"By the way, please take care of my messenger. It has great significance to me. Please ensure its safety."
"Maybe you will not understand, or even feel bored. But these little creatures are really very reasonable and unexpectedly smart. And it is really very important to me."
"That's all."|0|80
"I admire your courage and self-sacrificing spirit."
"I wish you an early discovery of the triple affirmative."

Wait! Look what I found!
There is something faintly written underneath, but a lot of it is scratched out.
I'll try my best to interpret it...|0|120
"If possible, please keep the little creature in front of you with you and don't let it come back to me."
"My..."|0|80
"...unable to..."|0|160
Ah, the rest is really unreadable! Sorry, little messenger.
Please give this to Five Pebbles! I hope you can help him. He really needs something to help him now.
Sorry, little creature. All I can do for you is this. If you want, you can stay here for a while longer.|0|60
