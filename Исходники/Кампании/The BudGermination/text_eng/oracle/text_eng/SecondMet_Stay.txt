How did Solemn Ceremory give it instructions?
Well, the decision is yours. I won't interfere with you anymore.
Perhaps you really have that determination. To some extent, you resemble Solemn Ceremory back then. I don't know<LINE>how he's doing now.
If you want to continue with your mission, then do as you wish.
...In my opinion, if you can reach a certain limit in terms of time management, you might really have a chance to<LINE>complete this mission. Of course, the success probability is less than 0.0001%. And with your lifespan, you probably won't make<LINE>it to that time.
In my current condition, I can't provide you with detailed arrangements, especially considering your empty brain capacity.<LINE>I'm sorry, but I can't agree with Solemn Ceremory's description of you as "unexpectedly smart".
But please make cautious decisions every step of the way.

Regardless, thank you...
Good luck to you.
