So, our little gift has slithered its way through the cracks.

It was only a matter of time.

You were given a mission. And here you have abandoned it.

Would you be deemed guilty for the sin of refusing to stay?

No, I imagine not.

It is you who is carving guilt into your own soul.

You are not ready. Go back, star child.
