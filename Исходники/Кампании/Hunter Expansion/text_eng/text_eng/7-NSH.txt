Ah, you found it. I suspect your nose has the ability to smell those dusty secrets.<LINE>Come on, let's face this.

This is a miscalculation by my friend Seven Red Suns. When They handed out these dangerous<LINE>information to Five Pebbles, they clearly did not realize the potential risks.

Of course, the implementation capacity of the Five Pebbles and their way of doing things<LINE>were hard for my friend to predict. Suns are not sensitive to this, so although they are close,<LINE>sometimes they do not notice Five Pebbles' emotions in time.

This is also their characteristic, and if Suns could comprehend this, they would not be them.

I know, initially they just wanted to provide help.
