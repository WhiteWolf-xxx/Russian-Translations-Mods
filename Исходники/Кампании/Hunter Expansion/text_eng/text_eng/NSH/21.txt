This is a conversation from an Iterator conversation group, in which five pebbles announced<LINE>his radical stance in breaking the self-destruction taboo,for the first time. Even anonymous, <LINE>it's still easy to recongnize him.

I am not unfamiliar with the impulse that drives him. I think all iterators share the<LINE>same feeling - that's why his comments have caused widespread unease.

If you pay more attention, it is easy to realize that he will go too far on this road. But at that time,<LINE>no one expected this to really happen - and in such a painful way.

Even if I can relive the whole story, I am still shocked.
