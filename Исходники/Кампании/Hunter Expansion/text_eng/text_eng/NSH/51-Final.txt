This is a letter I wrote to Moon. I didn't expect you to find it now. Little one,<LINE>do you know Looks to the Moon? Long ago, due to the recklessness of Five Pebbles,<LINE>she lost contact with us.

However, after many cycles of rain in the past, someone finally realized that he cannot always run away from his mistakes.

I am glad to see this.
