This is the architectural record of the transfer bridge which was built between Five Pebbles and<LINE>Looks To The Moon. As you can see, it has completely collapsed alongside Moon.

I suppose this is also a symbolic collapse. Through his actions, Five Pebbles destroyed the connection between them.

Who knows, maybe that was what he wanted. Oh, that's not my anger speaking for me, that's just my honest guess.

At first, Five Pebbles was built for Moon. No matter how strange it may seem to him,<LINE>this is the only reason why our creators gave him a "birth certificate".

This bridge seems to symbolize the meaning of his existence. Even from a distance, you can still tell <LINE> that it's a part of them. 

Perhaps Five Pebbles didn't even realised how much he cared about it. It's easy to tell from the outside, honestly. 

Now that he has destroyed it, I wonder if it's enough to calm his anger?

When he finally calms down and reflects on himself, he will definitely feel ashamed of it.
