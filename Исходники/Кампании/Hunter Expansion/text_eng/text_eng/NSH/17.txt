This is the blueprint of an aquifer somewhere. In the era when they were just beginning to build iterators, it was a necessary preparation to investigate the local water resources.

We need clean water to feed our internal microorganisms, just as you need body fluids. If we lack water resources then it'll only be a few cycles before our processes will stall, and then we will die.

Not a complete death. We can still feel the deterioration of equipment and the death of tissues. But we will no longer have any thinking ability.

It's like a nightmare. You can only watch it happen.

So that's why I feel so sad. Moon had suffered through this, and I don't know whether my help was effective.
