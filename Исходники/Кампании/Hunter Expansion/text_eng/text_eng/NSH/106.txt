This pearl encoded a simple hymn. It's such a novelty to make direct contact with the access trace of one of my kind... 

Seems like its owner treasured it very much. It shows traces of repetitive access, which happened not long ago. 

You must have took it from another iterator. I would suggest you to return it to its rightful owner, <PlayerName>.
