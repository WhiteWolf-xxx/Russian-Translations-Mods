Welcome back, Messenger.

My overseers have seen your return journey. I saw you opened the blockade of Five Pebbles<LINE>through that pearl, right?

Surprisingly, I almost ignored that I still had such a piece of information left in me. It was not<LINE>perfect, could not achieve the desired effect, so it was abandoned by me long ago.

... It must be Moon who reactivate it. This means that you have completed the task perfectly.<LINE>I want to thank you for this, my little messenger.

Nevertheless, I am still surprised by your choice. I showed you the path to ascension.<LINE>Before you return, you have enough time to break free from your own cycle. But now,<LINE>such opportunities no longer exist.

I'm very sorry. I can't cure you, and I'm not even a qualified caregiver. However, you still<LINE>traveled all the way back here. Sometimes I'm also curious, what do you want?

…...

I don't know what let you make this choice, but if this is what you want, you are welcome to stay here.

Anyway, your help means a lot to me.
