This is a chat record of a local group. Perhaps looking back on the past is<LINE>also my duty - now that you have brought it here.

During that period, the extreme radicalism of Five Pebbles caused anxiety among many members. <LINE>In this conversation, I openly expressed my attitude, hoping that he could see the absurdity of his position.

I didn't phrase my words carefully at that time. Now it seems that when it comes to<LINE>the issue of Five Pebbles, I always lose my judgment from restlessness.

In fact, this approach will only have a counterproductive effect on the obstinate ones.

<PlayerName>, are you making a face for me to say more?

I am not inclined to speak so eloquently about a tragedy... or rather,<LINE>the shock of this matter still leaves me unsure of where to start.
