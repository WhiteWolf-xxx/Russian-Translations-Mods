Did you do it, little saint? You have pulled me into an unparalleled dream. 

When all the cycles unfold before our eyes, the confusion of the past doesn't matter anymore.

But it's not entirely without confusion - your fate confuses me, it spirals forward, its edges twisted by unknown forces. 

What does that feel like? When we all find our own answers, is your own existence still a mystery?

Anyway, please accept my reverence towards you.
