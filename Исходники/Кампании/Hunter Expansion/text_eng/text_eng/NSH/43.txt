This is a conversation log in which the two parties are discussing the situation of Five Pebbles.<LINE>At that time, his experiment had just failed, and Moon had lost contact with us.<LINE>Everyone was worried about their situation.

I wish he had realized that he didn't have to clean up his mess alone. <LINE>I'm not sure if there was a better way at the time, but his self-isolation was a big obstacle to any possible help,<LINE>which was useless other than to protect his pathetic ego. Moreover, he also dragged Moon into all this. 

After that, there were indeed attempts to admonish him, but all ended in failure.
