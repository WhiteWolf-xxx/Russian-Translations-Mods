I don't want to read this text out aloud. I used to feel angry, but now I just feel sad.

In this message, we learned for the first time about BSM's disastrous situation. Five pebbles<LINE>is harming her, and we are trying our best to stop him.

It has been a long, long time since then. I hope Five Pebbles has regained his sanity and<LINE>reflected on his actions. He is so close to Moon that he can choose to make up for his mistakes<LINE>instead of going further down a wrong path.

Of course... I think he has already taken action now.
