Unbelievable! The interior of this capsule is filled with void fluid, but it maintains biological activity!

Any substance will continuously dissolve in the void fluid, and this capsule is no exception.<LINE>However, its internal cells maintain a high division rate, offsetting the destructive effects<LINE>through the method of creation.

This is very mystifying! If it can maintain stability under external disturbances,<LINE>then this would be a great specimen. Do you mind if I keep it for research?
