This is the message that Seven Red Suns brought to Five Pebbles when the incident occurred.

It's hard not to feel sad reading it now. but it is still a lovely letter,<LINE>I have never seen anyone write letters in this way... 

Anyhow, for the Five Pebbles at that moment, even with a lot of careful phrasing,<LINE> we could not rein in a horse at the edge of a cliff.

I hope Five Pebbles will eventually reflect on all of this. He cannot escape everything<LINE>that happened in those few rain cycles forever.
