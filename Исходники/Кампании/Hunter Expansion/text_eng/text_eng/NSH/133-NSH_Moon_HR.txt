NSH: Moon... This is true, isn't it? Do you also feel it?

BSM: Every repetition of our past cycle has been dismantled and exposed here, and the old patterns<LINE>that have lasted for a long time have been completely replaced. It seems that we no longer need to<LINE>turn back. Can this only be defined as a dream, or does it have more meaning than a dream?

NSH: It can neither be embedded in the past life, nor placed at the end. At this moment,<LINE>everthing, past, now, future... Coexists. Oh my god, we have really ascended.

BSM: Unbelievable, the answer is here all along. But before that, we were unable to verify its reliability.

NSH: Anyways, I am beginning to understand our creator's fascination with void<LINE>fluid. this may be the best occasion to reunite. 

BSM: This is a strong sense of liberation, even the simplest creatures in their minds will be<LINE>intoxicated by it. The cycles turned out to be such so exhausting.

NSH: Is that why someone still needs you to wake up, little saint?
