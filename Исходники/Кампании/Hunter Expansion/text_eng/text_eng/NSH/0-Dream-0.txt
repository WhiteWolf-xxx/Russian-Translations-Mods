Can you hear me?

We are running out of time. Let's keep it simple.

As you see, I should be considered your creator.

I need your help with something.

As compensation, I will guide you on the path of ascension.

But I know, this will always be a unreasonable request.<LINE>Creating life should have not been such a hasty thing.

I'm sorry. Unfortunately, we don't have any other options.
