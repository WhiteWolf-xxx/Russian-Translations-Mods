Oh, there you are, my little messenger.

Hope you have a comfortable time here. I haven't recycled the room you used. If you<LINE>want to reminisce about old times, you can go there for a stroll.

I have temporarily blocked some passages of the giant structure today. Please forgive me for not<LINE>letting you go outside or enter the depths of my structure. I'm not sure if you're aware of it, but<LINE>you're getting weak fast.

…

Do you want to play with me? I've never responded to your invitation before, but you're<LINE>actually more than welcome. If you want to do it, now's a great time~

If you're tired of playing, go take a break! But be sure to come back to me in the next cycle.
