This is a special plant that can compress and store air in these small sacs.

In the past, before the air circulation systems of iterators were built,<LINE>those working at high altitudes obtained oxygen through them.

However, the plant you brought is quite different from the original design blueprint!<LINE>Just like you, I think they are also keeping up with the times~
