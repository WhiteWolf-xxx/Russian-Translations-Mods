After all this time, a lifeline. Thank you.

This was…...a part of No Significant Harassment. NSH…...it's a familiar name. I can vaugely recall that he once offered great help to me. I hope one day I'll be able to thank him. 

Before reformatting this gift, I can read his conditions from it. Under such predicaments, he is still holding on. It's very inspiring, considering the current state of affairs.
