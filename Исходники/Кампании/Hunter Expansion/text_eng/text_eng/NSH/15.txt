This is the pipeline design diagram of a Void Fluid filtration system.

We can use it to purify the Void Fluid, and every time we receive a shipment we could also use a bit to send off one of my creators. 

I have this device in my structure, but it has been out of repair for a long time.

What a pity, otherwise we would have filled a bathtub and invited all the creatures on earth to queue up for a bath!

Haha, it's just a joke~

You should know that this will eventually be your destination.

But for your carefree little brain, this ending doesn't really matter. 

Am I right?
