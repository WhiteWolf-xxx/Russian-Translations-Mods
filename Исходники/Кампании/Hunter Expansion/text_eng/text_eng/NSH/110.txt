Wow! Look what you got me here! I won't say that I see it on a daily basis, same as you don't see your heart that often. 

We must treat it with caution - As I said, the mass rarefaction cell is crucial for iterators to function. 

Their storage spot usually has extra protection. Unless the relative structure has been damaged,<LINE>or the iterator itself gave the permission, it's near impossible for you to gain access of it. 

That being said, I find it hard to imagine where in the world did you get it from. Did someone entrusted you with it,<LINE>or did you took advantage of someone? Traveling with it is not easy, so I guess you didn't do it on a whim. 

Where are you taking it to? No matter what, I hope you treat it with respect and caution.
