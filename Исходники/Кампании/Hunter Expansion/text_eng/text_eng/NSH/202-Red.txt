Its data compiling style is very familiar... I think it comes from a member of the local group.<NEXT>There isn't much left inside. I think this is a part of the unstructured grid of a physical field,<LINE>but I lack information to further interpret it.

This is a calculation process used to carefully encrypt and store special data, possibly some kind of key.<NEXT>Without context, I don't know its purpose.

Strange... This data clearly comes from an iterator. But there are several small errors inside, even though they have been carefully corrected, traces can still be seen.<NEXT>We rarely make mistakes in calculations, so its creator was certainly not paying attention. 

This is a log of a working memory, but I can only interpret a few words. <NEXT>It is obvious that the compiler used some method to compress his information, in order to store it in a short period of time and perform more operations.<NEXT>This iterator had to handle an urgent task, which overwhelmed him, but his operations were still well-organized.<NEXT>Ah, a strange feeling of déjà vu…

This is a biome log, and its owner has observed and recorded the evolution of nearly a hundred species of organisms within their region.<NEXT>I hope you didn't steal it, little creature. The time span of the edits is dramatic, and its owner persisted in updating its data until a long time ago.<NEXT>But for a long time recently, the writer seems to have forgotten it.

This is a special qualia... it's a dying experience.<NEXT>We all know that the near death experience of the ancients was not accompanied by fear, so obviously, this data is extracted from a simple creature.<NEXT>I can distinguish the primordial desire for survival - perhaps it's from the brain of a squidcada.<NEXT>I find it difficult to imagine whether it will have any practical use.
