Ah, you found it. I suspect your nose has the ability to smell dusty little secrets.<LINE>Come on, let's address this.

This is a miscalculation by my friend Seven Red Suns. When They handed out these dangerous<LINE>information to Five Pebbles, they clearly did not realize the potential risks.

Of course, the executive ability of Five Pebbles and their way of doing things<LINE>were hard for my friend to predict. Suns is not perceptive, so although they are close,<LINE>sometimes they failed to notice Five Pebbles' feelings.

This is their personality. If they were any different, then they simply won't be the Seven Red Suns we know and love. 

I know. They just wanted to help.
