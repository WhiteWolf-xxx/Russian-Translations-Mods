I remember this, it was written by Five Pebbles. And it was evident that he had modified the pearl,<LINE>but it was not clean work - he was young at the time.

At that time, he was still committed to the mission given by our creators, and this was one of his research projects,<LINE>but none of that matters now.

In fact, few of us really believe we can find the answer to that great question. This has become more and more the<LINE>case over time, which is why the death of Sliver of Straw has caused such a stir.

Later, although Five Pebbles' goals changed, his ambition and conceit did not diminish... He got the ending he deserved,<LINE>but that wasn't any of us wanted to see.
