Can you feel it? The feeling of life passing by over time? Do not be afraid, for this is just<LINE> a premonition of your fate: you are about to enter the next cycle.

Do you understand what the cycle means to you? As you roamed through the ruins of civilizations, you<LINE>may have noticed their reluctance to the cycle. But I believe that for a free little creature like you,<LINE>going down the cycle will just be like a light jump.

You will have a healthy body and a free new life. You may become a squidcada, a centipede, a lizard...<LINE>Of course, you may still be a cute slugcat!

If there is a cycle in the future where you become a vulture, remember to help me see how small the land<LINE>that traps us is! Haha, those steel mazes must look as small as a rock!

Do you yearn for it? A new cycle is about to begin, and you will wake up again soon.

Thank you for everything you did for us, my brave messenger. I wish you a pleasant journey.
