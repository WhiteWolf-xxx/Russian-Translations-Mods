Oh? This is a conversation log, which happened not long ago, and the reason why Seven Red Suns<LINE>entrusted you with a message.

Due to the radicalisation and self-isolation of Five Pebbles, we had completely lost contact with him<LINE>and his neighbor, Looks to the Moon.

Five Pebbles is in terrible condition right now, both physically and mentally, but what worries me more<LINE>is Moon's situation. There is barely any rain coming from her can. If things are as I feared... I don't<LINE>want to imagine the worst-case scenario.

It's time for you to keep going, and I hope you can try to hurry, before things are irreparable.
