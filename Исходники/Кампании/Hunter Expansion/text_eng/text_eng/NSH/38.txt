It's just a movement acceptance invoice, nothing interesting, <PlayerName>.

This is one of the crazy laws issued by the twenty-second Subsistence Council, requiring all harvestable crops<LINE>to be harvested before final public ascension. For those individuals who hope to delay their ascention, this was not<LINE>very kind! <LINE>At that time, they used all means to unify their order when stepping into the Void Sea. But upon closer examination,<LINE>there is an obvious greed hidden behind this obsession. Fortunately, the Void Sea is not a strict judge.

This is a memory about a family portrait. The original intention was to attract families of the same caste<LINE> of aristocrats for alliances.<LINE>But it's obvious that this is either a clumsy imitation or a satire. My feeling is that although our creators<LINE>were extremely rigid, sometimes they were also unexpectedly funny.

This is a catalog of components for sky-sail joinery. If you don't understand what a sky-sail is, you can try<LINE>imagining a mini version of a vulture.<LINE>Don't look so confused!<LINE>If it can make you feel better, those sky-sails are much more harmless than vultures. The ancients then <LINE>shifted too much of their attention to ascension, so the research on sky-sails stopped at entertainment purposes.

This poor person was trying to imitate the classical style of writing. This is a necessity, as some ideas have to cling to<LINE>a specific form.<LINE>But unfortunately, the old era has become a thing of the past. He writes well, but no one listens anymore.

This is a blueprint for some building support beams. Okay, there's nothing interesting about it.

This is a schematic of a purposed organism. I guess you've encountered these guys while passing by the<LINE>garbage dump. But this is still an early version, which means it won't go berserk when you attack it. When<LINE>our creators designed these things, they could manipulate biological instincts for their own gain. How cunning~

This is an old schematic for a gas filtration machine, which looks very roughly crafted<LINE>and the design needs improvement.

This is the genome of a sulfur-processing microbe. This version has already been replaced.

It's the blueprint for a small incense purification filter. A necessity for my creators to live on superstructures.

A model of a fluid carrying pipe section. I guess you don't really need this, and neither do I. 

You have found a rare good! This is a simple diamond sphere, and upon closer inspection,<LINE>you can see the difference between it and the pearls. Keep it to youself, little one.

Hmm... Someone abused this pearl. This type of engraving does not seem to have been done by scavengers,<LINE>nor does it seem to have been mechanically engraved. But it has been engraved back and forth thousands of<LINE>times, and it feels like the obsession is deeper than an echo. However, even if it really comes from our creators,<LINE>it's hard to surprise me!

This pearl has been damaged and is no longer useful to us. However, scavengers will definitely like it,<LINE>and you can go to them to exchange what you need.

There is only one blurry image inside... a strip of fabric? This pearl has faded, so I cannot<LINE>tell you more information.

This is a delicate creative work! The producer did not use any data format to record information, but<LINE>directly drew a complex pattern inside its lattice. In other words, they made a micro sculpture. I'm glad<LINE>to see such an interesting creation. Thank you, <PlayerName>.

This pearl has faded severely, leaving only some unreadable garbled characters inside.

Oh... I have to regret to tell you that you brought a completely blank pearl!

Okay, this one is completely empty.

Completely blank - it must have waited all this time for someone to come by and put it to use. Unfortunately, no one has done so yet.

I have unfortunate news to tell you: there are no interesting stories or practical functions <LINE>in this pearl. Actually, there's nothing here!

This one has nothing - not even a symbol.

Empty! However, you can toy with it. After all, it is a beautiful sphere.

It is already broken and nothing can be extracted.

This is an infinitely nested pearl image. Are you curious about what it symbolizes? But we aren't able to<LINE>know it anymore.<LINE>It may symbolize the eternal cycle, which is the least fresh topic in ancient civilization. But it's more likely that<LINE>it's just a small joke.<LINE>It's not much use, just go toy with it~

"...through the mists of memory, your image dances, like the motes of dust, in a ray of sunlight that<LINE>pierces a dark room." <LINE>It is a line of verse from the ancient farmer-poet Pel. He has the wonderful ability to visualize abstract<LINE>experiences! If you bring me a few more of his works, <PlayerName>, I might feel like lying on the<LINE>ground and passionately telling you about my past.<LINE>Haha, no way you really believed me?

This is a catalog of tea brewing techniques. Most of the raw materials were very rare and went extinct<LINE>with the ascension of the ancients. So unfortunately, you can't taste it anymore.

Little one, you have dug up a real treasure of art! Don't worry, I will try to describe it to you.<LINE>

In the painting, there is a filter feeding plant that has been thirsty for a long time, with five bottles of water<LINE>placed on its surface.<LINE>Many of our creators claimed that this painting caused them physiological pain.<LINE>In the era of the strictest bans, distribution was even banned at one point.<LINE>Perhaps you can empathize with their desires, but it's difficult to understand their struggles. Believe me, this<LINE>is exactly what makes you cute!

This is an excerpt from a classical long poem. This poetry is particularly ancient, and the author chose to remain anonymous.<LINE>I remember he recounted his eleven suicides and cycles, and gave an exceptionally pessimistic prophecy at the end.<LINE>The excerpt here is a heavy and tedious reasoning... <LINE>I guess you're already drowsy from listening, little one~

There are 71 numbers here, it's hard to guess their purpose!

Let's keep this pearl a secret. Some things are not suitable for you to listen to, nor are they suitable for me to say.

This pearl records a simple hymn. Hey, even if you stare at me like this, I can't sing to you~<LINE>Alright, I'll try to find a way to play it.

"Dear diary..." Then it ends. 

This is a diary written by an underground construction worker. He wrote extensively about his insomnia<LINE>and nightmares.<LINE>During that period, people were anxiously striving to unveil the shroud of mystery that covered the void sea<LINE> and simultaneously gave birth to a golden age of classic horror literature.<LINE>And these diaries are obviously more documentary than fictional literature. It's very interesting. If you can<LINE>understand, I'm even willing to read it to you as a bedtime story~

This one originally recorded some simple geometric theories of the ancients. Now, I would say it only records<LINE>the artisanship of scavengers.<LINE>Their drilling technology has improved a lot, but there is still a lot of room for improvement. It's hard not<LINE>to wonder to what extent the scavenger tribe can evolve after ten thousand cycles of rain.<LINE>Haha, from your expression, they are already tricky enough now, aren't they?

The data of this pearl has been scrambled multiple times. It may store some valuable confidential<LINE>information. Perhaps it is a business document? Of course, after our creators left, these secrets<LINE>are now worthless.

This is a growing instruction for the skeleton of a creature. It looks about the same size as you,<LINE>but I would say you're far cuter, <PlayerName>.

There is nothing on it except for the number 8. Um... Maybe someone drew lots with pearls?

There's nothing interesting about this pearl, it just contains a numerical sequence. This may be a key<LINE>or an identification code, but it is definitely invalid now.

This is a number series, which could be a kind of cipher.

This document records information about various weapons. But it's obvious that there hasn't been any new<LINE>weapons produced on this land for a long time - oh, let alone the rebars you're using. Throughout the history<LINE>of writing, our creators tended to use swords to symbolize rules and knights, rather than violent impulses.<LINE>This is very interesting, isn't it? It seems that the consequences of violence are quite frightening.

This is a journal that attempts to confuse the void fluids with antimatter. How imaginative! Our creators<LINE>always came up with some strange ideas. Sometimes I think they are trying to please the public, but they<LINE>are more likely to be just too excited.

This pearl is occupied entirely in memory by a completely blank image. This is quite interesting, I guess the creator<LINE>is expressing their reverence for nothingness. At least in the small pearl universe, he can create absolute tranquility.

How ambitious was the person who wrote this set of code! His goal was to conduct complex simulations of our world.<LINE>Regardless of the accuracy, the workload is already staggering. Let me see......<LINE>Optimistically speaking, he has only completed less than 1%. This is an interesting attempt, but unfortunately public<LINE>ascension interrupted it. I guess many people have work that they don't want to give up until the end, but no one<LINE>can tolerate loneliness. So even if someone tries to stay, in the end, we are still the only ones left.

It records a special language that transmits information through gestures and facial expressions. Do you<LINE>want to learn?<LINE> I can complete the gesture part, you can use expressions. The Triple affirmative has no hope left! I don't mind leaving<LINE>some time to practice this with you.
