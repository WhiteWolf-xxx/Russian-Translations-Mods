This is the genome of a purposed organism, a menial cleaning slug.

This gene sequence is quite simple, and it must be an early product of purposed organism<LINE>technology. You two species share a common word in your names, but don't mistake<LINE>them for your ancestors~

Do you know about purposed organisms? Actually, we both are. For us, a blueprint is<LINE> like an invitation letter to the world.

It is obvious that your lineage has shed the scent of artificial creation, and your cute little ears<LINE>are once again flapping for no one but mother nature.
