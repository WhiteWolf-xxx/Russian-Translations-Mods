... Oh, hello? 

You interrupted my thoughts, little guy! However, I believe I can take you as my priority for now,<LINE>because the questions plaguing my mind aren't going to go away anytime soon. 

In fact, I've been musing about a strange thing. Not so long ago,<LINE>an old friend of mine showed signs of recovering functionality.<LINE>At the mean time, the rain clouds above her neighbor stopped condensation. 

What happened? This has been nagging me nonstop... So please pardon me for being so distracted!<LINE>I redirected all my processing power for this to try to figure it out. 

Sometimes I am envious of you! You can so easily scurry to the place where I want to go,<LINE>in less than ten rain cycles, perhaps. 

But, even with so much doubts, I guess it's still a good thing... 

Oh, sorry that I'm rambling! In fact, There's only one thing that I want you to know:<LINE>Don't eat my neurons!
