Oh? Hello, I haven't encountered a little guest like you in a while.

You look very primitive, but you have been marked.<LINE>Have you met Seven Red Suns, Chasing Wind, or other iterators?<LINE>Wherever you are from, you must have gone a long way here, little traveler.

You can rest here for a while. This place used to be known as a temple,<LINE>but now I don't mind being treated as a hotel~
