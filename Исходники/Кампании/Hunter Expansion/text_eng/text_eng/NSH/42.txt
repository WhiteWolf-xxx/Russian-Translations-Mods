This information records the controversy caused by Five Pebbles among the parliaments,<LINE>which is exactly the same as I remembered.

During that period, our creators were particularly noisy. They even caused several instances of violent destruction,<LINE>and I didn't spare any effort to figure out the entire reason.

No iterator would take their public opinion to heart, except for Five Pebbles himself - at that time,<LINE>I noticed our new member's angry silence.

This has been a long time since. Five Pebbles is not sophisticated enough to be difficult to read, <LINE>but even if we can understand him, we still won't know how to deal with him.

Don't be curious. Even if you don't understand these things, you can still understand your little world~
