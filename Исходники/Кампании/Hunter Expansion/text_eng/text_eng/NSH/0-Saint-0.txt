Oh... hello. I guess you can understand me, right? 

Ha, how interesting! Even the slugcats evolved fur in the ice age! 

Come on, although my room may be barely warm enough to keep out the cold.<LINE>I have always loved the companionship of your kind, especially in recent cycles.

To this day, this land is still trapped here with us...

I hope you can leave when you want. You know, the void sea is always open for you.
