Is this... a photo album? I can see many photos taken by the overseers.

This pearl records a lot of landscapes, some of which are likely not from around here.<LINE>I can also see some fascinating scenes of local fauna.<LINE>I can't identify these creatures, so I assume the overseers must have gone far away.

Oh... here's another a photo. Looks like someone took a photo of my puppet.<LINE>Perhaps this is a joke from a friend? I don't know, but I think I like it.<LINE>Thank you, little one.
