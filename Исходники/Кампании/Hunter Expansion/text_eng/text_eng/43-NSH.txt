This is a conversation journal in which the two sides of the conversation are discussing the situation of Five Pebbles.<LINE>At that time, his experiment had just failed, and Moon has lost contact with us. Everyone is worried about their affairs.

I wish he had realized that he wasn't alone in solving the problems he had caused.<LINE>I'm not sure if there was a better way at the time, but his self-isolation was a big obstacle to any possible help,<LINE>which was useless other than to maintain his pathetic self-esteem. Moreover, he also implicated Moon.

After that, there were indeed attempts to admonish him, but all ended in failure.
