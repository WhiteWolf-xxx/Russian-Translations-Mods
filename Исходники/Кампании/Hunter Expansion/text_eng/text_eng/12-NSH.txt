This is the production record of a mask factory. The name of this facility is... "Side House", I think it should be<LINE>translated like this.

Our creators obtain pellets of holy ash through these facilities and use them to make masks. <PlayerName>, you<LINE>can't imagine how obsessed my creators are with masks! When self-restraint becomes a necessary condition for<LINE>ascension, masks have become a popular spiritual symbol, as covering one's own face can symbolize self-restraint.

I think this is because when you wear a mask, all your expressions are obscured, and you cannot express your<LINE>emotions through facial movements.

Of course, this behavior subsequently became completely superficial. The gorgeous mask has become an expression<LINE>of identity. People want to suppress their desires under their masks... haha! The result is simply to turn these desires<LINE>into decorations such as pearls and gemstones, which are blatantly embedded in masks.
