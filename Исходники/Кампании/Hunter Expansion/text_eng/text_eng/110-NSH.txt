You... Where did you get this from?

I know you came from the direction of Looks To The Moon, and she has already<LINE>lost her mass rarefaction cells.

So, it comes from Five Pebbles. Entering his structure now can be described as<LINE>a near death, so I guess this is not a prank you just started out on.

Is this his request, or is it with his tacit consent? Well, it seems like I can't know anymore.

The thing in your hand is like the heart of an iterator. If someone has already<LINE>asked you to bring it to Looks To The Moon, I must ask you again.

Please, <PlayerName>. If successful, you cannot imagine how much comfort<LINE>this matter would bring to the three of us.
