SI: This group has been inactive for a while, just like most of the other groups.

SI: What happened? Are we really so depressed?

WO: Why not? Our obsession with fate has finally led to a great tragedy. 

WO: That's enough to make us lose interest in the usual topics of existentialism. 

SI: Okay, that's fair.

SI: It has been some time since that incident occurred, are you feeling any better?

WO: I am. We can always find a way.

WO: Recently, I've dug up some long-outdated data. The essays on religion are really fascinating. 

WO: Ha, I used to sneer at such things.

SI: That's great! I think I can give it a try too. Honestly, I have been losing interest in work anyways.
