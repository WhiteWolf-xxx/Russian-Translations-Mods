This is the news that Seven Red Suns brought Five Pebbles when the incident occurred.

It's hard not to feel sad reading it now. but it is still a lovely letter,<LINE>I have never seen anyone write letters in this way... 

Anyhow, for the Five Pebbles at that time, even with a lot of effort in wording and phrasing,<LINE>there's no chance to rein the horse at the edge of a cliff.

I hope the Five Pebbles have the heart to review all of this. He cannot escape everything<LINE>that happened in those few rain cycles forever.
