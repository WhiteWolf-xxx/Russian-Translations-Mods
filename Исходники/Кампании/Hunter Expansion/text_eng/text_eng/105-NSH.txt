This is a log of microbial levels in the waste digestion tank. I can't believe you've<LINE>reached such a low position.

That's a spectacular place. During its normal operation, the deafening roar never stopped. 

This technology has had many challenges to overcome, and even now, there are still some small problems<LINE>that need to be solved. Our creators have put a lot of effort into creating various structures, and they have<LINE>also put a considerable amount of effort into breaking them down.

Of course, they put in more effort to erase themselves than to decompose waste.

I have to say, um, very visionary. It seems like they are very clear that there is something that doesn't need<LINE>to exist more than waste... Oh, why are you looking at me like that, little one? Those creatures are no longer<LINE>here, so now we can get it off our chest~
