Wow, look what you found!

This is a photo album of mine. Sometimes I command my overseers to take a long trip,<LINE>and record footage of my friends' region.

There's even a picture of a Moon's puppet here!<LINE>Normally, there's no way for an overseer to travel that far.<LINE>But with careful guidance, these little ones can go beyond their limits.

I think it was lost during my busiest time.<LINE>The scavengers slipped into my structure, and I didn't even notice.

Thanks, little guy, for helping me find it, it really means a lot for me.
