I didn't expect to have the opportunity to revisit this……This article was written by Moon<LINE>for Sliver of Straw.<LINE>It's a long story.

After the death of Sliver of Straw, the information she left behind caused significant fluctuations in iterators.

For a moment, almost everyone had something to say - after working hard for a long time on our common<LINE>responsibility, the potential breakouts brought about by the loss of control were also expected.

Some iterators, when making various speculations, have forgotten to consider all aspects of dignity.<LINE>At that time, and there have also been a group of extreme proposals, which are not lacking in danger.

I know Moon will try to stabilize the situation, and she did indeed do so.

This article is pertinent and powerful, with her style very much.
