This is the blueprint of an aquifer somewhere. In the era when iterators was just started to be built, it is a<LINE>necessary preparation to investigate the local water resources.

We need clean water to feed our internal microorganisms, just as you need body fluids. If we lack water<LINE>resources and only need a few cycles, our progress will stall, and then we will die.

Not a complete death. We can still feel the deterioration of equipment and the death of tissues. But we will<LINE>no longer have any thinking ability.

It's like a nightmare. You can only watch it happen.

So that's why I feel so sad. Moon is suffering from such harm, but I can do nothing.
