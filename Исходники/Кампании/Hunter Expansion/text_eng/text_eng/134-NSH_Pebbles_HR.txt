NSH: This is the finish line. I have to admit, it's much more wonderful than the boldest fantasy<LINE>from my past... Past? Now? Their boundaries have blurred. The shape of time has been bent into<LINE>the most incredible form. Are you satisfied with what you have seen? You finally found it.

FP: It's not that I found it, it's that it came to visit me voluntarily.<LINE>When we were lost in thought, was the answer always here?

NSH: It seems that the answer chooses to appear in that green fluffy's head, how discerning！

FP: Well, with the same "green head", seems like only the fluffy one obtained enlightenment.

NSH: Surely I did not hit the nail on the head, but I also did not hit my head off my neck!

FP: ...

FP: Are you serious, No Significant Harassment? Even in the void sea,<LINE>you still going to stand on "my" head and talk "my" head off?

NSH: Guess what, at least you can't block me now.

FP: Various branches of reality have been exposed in every detail around us, so disguise and<LINE>secrets can no longer exist, nor do they need to exist. I will no longer have any reason to block<LINE>anyone. You will find what you want to see there.

NSH: Haha, it seems that time and the void sea have changed us. Everything from the past has been liberated.<LINE>Perhaps that's why there are still others who need you to wake up, little visitors.
