I remember this, it was written by Five Pebbles. And it was evident that he had done something to the pearl,<LINE>but it was not mature - he was young at the time.

At that time, he was still committed to the mission given by our creator, and here is one of his research results,<LINE>but none of that matters now.

In fact, few of us really think we can find the answer to that great question. This has become more and more the<LINE>case over time, which is why the death of Sliver of Straw has caused such a stir.

Later, although Five Pebbles' goals changed, his ambition and conceit did not diminish... He got the retribution he deserved,<LINE>but that wasn't what any of us wanted to see.
