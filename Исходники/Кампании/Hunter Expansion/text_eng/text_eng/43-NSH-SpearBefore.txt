Oh? This is a conversation log, which happened not long ago, and is the reason why Seven Red Suns<LINE>entrusted you with a message.

Due to the radicalization and self-isolation of Five Pebbles, we have completely lost contact with him<LINE>and his neighbor,  Looks to the Moon.

Five Pebbles are in terrible condition right now, in every sense of the word. And what worries me more<LINE>is the situation of Moon, whose cans are barely coming out of the rain. if things are as I guessed... I don't<LINE>want to imagine the worst-case scenario.

It's time for you to keep going, and I hope you can try to hurry, before things are irreparable.
