This is the genome of a  purposed organism, a  menial cleaning slug.

This gene sequence is quite simple, and it must be an early product of purposed organism<LINE>technology development. Your species names contain the same words, but don't mistake<LINE>them for your ancestors~

Do you know about purposed organism? Actually, we are both . a design drawing is<LINE>an invitation letter for us to visit the world.

It is obvious that your lineage has shed the scent of artificial creation, and your small ears<LINE>are once again spinning for natural drive.
