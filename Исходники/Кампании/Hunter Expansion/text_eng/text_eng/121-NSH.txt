This is a blueprint for a living area cell, which is clearly used to store organic waste.

As a long-term traveler who travels through mountains and rivers, I guess you must have seen<LINE>the corresponding architecture. They have been abandoned for a long time and must have been<LINE>transformed into comfortable nests by lizards, centipedes, and fungi.

Do you know? Almost all living organisms outside are descendants of functional<LINE>organisms - that is to say, designed by our creators.

It's interesting to watch these abandoned creatures crawl into the abandoned structures,<LINE>settle and reproduce after they disappear. Nature is reconstructing itself in a unique way.

Haha, okay, of course you don't find it interesting. I forgot that those who live there<LINE>are all your enemies!
