This information records the controversy caused by Five Pebbles among the parliaments,<LINE>which is exactly the same as what I remember.

During that period, our creators were particularly noisy, even caused several instances of violent destruction,<LINE>and I didn't spare any effort to figure out the entire reason.

No iterator would take their public opinion to heart, except for Five Pebbles himself - at that time,<LINE>I noticed the new member's angry silence.

This has been a long time since. Five Pebbles is not complex enough to be difficult to understand, <LINE>but even if we can understand them, we don't know how to deal with them.

Don't be curious. Even if you don't understand these things,<LINE>you can still understand your little world~
