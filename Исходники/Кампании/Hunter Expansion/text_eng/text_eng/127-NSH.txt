<CapItemPlayerName>, this is not a safe collectible.

This is a low density mass rarefaction cell. Although quality diluted batteries are a precious<LINE>resource for us, they have lost their value. Its shielding layer is damaged, and it is now impossible<LINE>to safely extract the energy contained within it.

Of course, unsafe methods exist. But I don't recommend using it as a weapon unless<LINE>absolutely necessary. The best solution is to stay away from it.
