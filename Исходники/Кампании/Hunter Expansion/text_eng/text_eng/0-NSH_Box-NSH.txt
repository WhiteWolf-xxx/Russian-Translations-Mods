Oh, this is a operation log from my boxroom.

When the old ecosystem collapsed, our creators built these small boxes,<LINE>in order to preserve the genetic information of the previous biota.

However, over time, they have become increasingly dependent on our existence.<LINE>They need more functional organisms, but cannot create independently.<LINE>So this place has transformed from a library into a cultivation and exhibition room.

Of course, it belongs to me now!

These small boxes are very useful when you can do nothing but stand here.<LINE>If we need to cultivate purposed organisms, it can help us save a lot of time.

This pearl is an essential part for the boxroom to function.<LINE>So I would like you to put it back in its original place, little one.
