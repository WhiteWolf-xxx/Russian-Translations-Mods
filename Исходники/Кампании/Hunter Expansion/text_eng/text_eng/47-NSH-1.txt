What are you doing?

I watched you go out a long way, but I didn't expect you to return to the starting point.<LINE>Are you bewildered, little one?

I wish I had a channel to find out what's wrong with you,<LINE>but you and I don't speak the same language.

Please, don't give up now. Can you please hang in there for us?
