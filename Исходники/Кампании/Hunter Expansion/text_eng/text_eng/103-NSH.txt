This is the architectural record of the transfer bridge, which was built between Five Pebbles and<LINE>Looks To The Moon. As you can see, it has completely collapsed with the collapse of Moon.

This is a symbolic collapse. Through his actions, Five Pebbles destroyed the connection between them.

Who knows, maybe this is what he wants - Oh, this is not my anger, it's just a guess.

At first, Five Pebbles were built for Moon. No matter how strange it may seem to him,<LINE>this is the only reason why our creators gave him a birth certificate.

This bridge seems to symbolize the meaning of his existence. Even from a distance, it can<LINE>still be seen that it is a part of them.

Perhaps Five Pebbles didn't even know how much he cared about this. But this is easy to observe.

Now that he has destroyed it, I wonder is this enough to calm his anger?

When he finally calms down and sees himself clearly, he will definitely feel ashamed of it.
