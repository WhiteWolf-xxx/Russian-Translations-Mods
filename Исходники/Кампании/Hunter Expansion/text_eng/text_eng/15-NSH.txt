We can use it to purify the Void Fluid, which can send away one of our creators every time we receive a portion.

I have this device in my structure, but it has been out of repair for a long time.

You should know that this will eventually be your destination.

But for your carefree little brain, this ending doesn't really matter. 

Did I guess it right?
