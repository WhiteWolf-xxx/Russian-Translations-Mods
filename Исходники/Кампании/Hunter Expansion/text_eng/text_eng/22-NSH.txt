This is a chat record of a local group. Perhaps looking back on the past is<LINE>also my duty - since you have brought it.

During that period, the extreme radicalism of Five Pebbles caused anxiety among many members. <LINE>In this conversation, I openly expressed my attitude, hoping that he could see the absurdity of his position.

I didn't consider the words and phrases at that time. Now it seems that when it comes to<LINE>the issue of Five Pebbles, I always lose my judgment due to restlessness.

In fact, this approach will only have a counterproductive effect on the obstinate ones.

<PlayerName>, is your expression expecting me to say more?

I am not inclined to speak eloquently about a tragedy... or rather,<LINE>the shock of this matter still leaves me unsure where to start.
