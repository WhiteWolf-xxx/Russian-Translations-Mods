Quaeledy.hunterexpansion-description|Six dream scenes and a new ending (with two variations) have been added for the Hunter. Basic behaviors for NSH have been implemented, along with parts of his superstructure. NSH's dialogues have been added to the [Collection] section. <LINE>I dedicate this work to my friends. This mod is not canon. I made it for my friends who wanted to see NSH in the game. I hope you enjoy this mod.

This is a calculation process used to carefully encrypt and store special data, possibly some kind of key.|这是一份计算过程，用于仔细地加密和保存特殊的数据，可能是某种密钥。
Without context, I don't know its purpose.|没有前后文的情况下，我不知道它的目的。

// 3
Strange... This data clearly comes from an iterator. But there are several small errors inside, even though they have been carefully corrected, traces can still be seen.|奇怪……这份数据显然来自一位迭代器。但它里面有好几个小错误，尽管被小心地修改了，仍然可以看出痕迹。
We rarely make mistakes in calculations, so its creator was certainly not paying attention.|我们很少在计算上犯错，它的书写者肯定心不在焉。
