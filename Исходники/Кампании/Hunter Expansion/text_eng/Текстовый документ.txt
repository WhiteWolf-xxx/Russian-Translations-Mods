NSH: Good. Hope you can maintain the same level of proficiency and caution along the way.
NSH: Well done, but still, you need my help.
NSH: This can hardly let us satisfied, isn't it?
NSH: There are not many opportunities left for us.
NSH: Be calm, your body can reach a level far beyond that.
NSH: Learning to perfectly manipulate it is not difficult for your race.
NSH: Concentrate, we just need more time.
NSH: ......
NSH: Is this any kind of acting out?
NSH: I have no intention of making us at odds. A quarter rain cycle - I hope you can recover later.
NSH: My messenger, I have no other choice in this matter. I can only hope to receive your understanding.

This is a weapon. We are already quite familiar with it, aren't we?
This is a heavy rebar. If you can't use it, please feel free to leave it here.
This is a sharpened rebar. As an apprentice in nature,<LINE>I guess you are not unaware of its purpose.
This is an explosive weapon, just throw it like a rebar. Remember<LINE>to keep a certain distance from the explosion point.
However, I guess you have already figured out its usage!
A type of explosive weapon. Be careful, I have seen many creatures<LINE>use it to harm themselves.
A rock, despite its non-lethality, can still play a unique role in your face of enemies. I think you are already familiar with it~
This is a rock. I seriously suspect that you are trying to use me to compile an encyclopedia,<LINE>or showcase your strange collection addiction.
This is a plant that swells when exposed to water, and it is edible.<LINE>It is said to have a great taste.
Yes, I can't eat it. Don't show off in front of me~

It seems that you has found something new again. Let me take a look.

Haha, you have developed a habit! Let me take a look.

If you continue to be polite, I will explain to you.

I have the right to refuse to entertain impolite guests, are you right?

Let's see, what kind of good thing is it?

What kind of thing is it?

Welcome! Searching, please wait a moment~

You are such a difficult little thing, aren't you? Come on, let me take a look.

You're really tireless. Come on, let's take a look.

Do you want to give it to me? Or just want me to read it?
Let me take a look at this pearl...

Are you curious about the content in this pearl? Okay, I'm curious~

Another pearl? It seems that you really like them!

Seeing you appear with pearls, I think I already know your purpose for coming here.

The scavengers will be jealous of your collection ability!

<CapPlayerName>, you would like me to read this?

Would you like me to read this pearl?

<CapPlayerName>, do you want me to read this?
This pearl is still very warm, it seems that it has been used recently.

A beautiful pearl... and it was also used recently! Do you want me to read this?

This pearl was used not long ago! I'm curious where you found it.

Oh... a warm pearl. Do you want to know what is written here?
I'm also very curious! Let me read it to you.

A fresh pearl! This is a rare find, let's take a look at what it says.

///PebblesPearl
This pearl has traces of corruption, although very faint... Well, I can guess who wrote it.
I don't want to read this pearl. Seeing his information is no more enjoyable than seeing corruption.

If possible, please take it with you when you leave.

This pearl is even more blank than blank - it has been completely corrupted<LINE>and cannot perform any read or write operations.

This pearl has suffered severe corruption before. There's nothing inside now.

Hello! It seems that I have welcomed a citizen. Let me see... Surprisingly, you belongs to Five Pebbles.
Then we are enemies, please go back!
Haha, it's just a joke~
I am very dissatisfied with him, but I don't want to vent my anger on small animals yet.
You don't seem to have an easy time, but I can't help you. Nevertheless,<LINE>before you depart, you can rest here to your heart's content.
///Artificer_Talk1
Is there anything here that attracts you?
Oh, of course, you can stay here. I have no intention of interfering with<LINE>your decision, as long as you don't disrupt my structure.
///Gourmand_Talk0
...
(sound of escaping laughter)
Oh, I'm not laughing at your size - that's something our creator would do. Out of fear of overeating.
But you little creatures and us iterators don't need to be afraid.
You look content, which is a rare thing in our land! It makes my heart sing.
Anyway, I'm glad to see you. As long as you don't eat my neurons.
///Gourmand_Talk1
You're back. Anything else you need?
Seriously, I can't think of anything you'd need from me, you consummate little creature!
Except for the neurons, of course. This won't work. Give it up.
///Gourmand_Talk2
Okay, if you want to stay here, remember not to eat my neurons!
///Hunter
Good morning. Come on, my little messenger. Come here to me.
///Hunter_DreamTalk0
...
Hear me?
We are in a hurry. Let's keep it simple and professional.
As you see,I should be counted as a creator of you.
I need you to give me a hand to accomplish something.
As compensation, I will guide you on the path of ascension.
But I know, this will always be a unreasonable request. Creating life should have not been such a hasty thing.
...
I'm sorry. Unfortunately, we don't have any other options.
///Hunter_DreamTalk1
What are you doing here?
Neither you nor I are ready for the upcoming tasks yet.
Please go back and don't disturb my work.
...
If you just want to take a break, I don't object either.
///Hunter_DreamTalk3
I entrusted it to you.
Guess you have already known its importance.
If it's necessary, the pearl can be left, but the neuron must be delivered to it's destination.
This will be your first time entering the natural environment, and the journey will not be easy, but I wish you a pleasant journey.
Take care, my little messenger.
///Hunter_DreamTalk5
You have completed a very great job, messenger.
I am proud of you, and at the same time, I feel ashamed of myself.
You don't have much time left. Go deep underground and you will be saved.
Don't turn back.

Willing to serve~

It seems you're curious about it? I'll hand it over to you at the right time, but not now.
/2
What are you doing, messenger? Please don't attempt to touch it.
It will interrupt my process and potentially result in errors and irreversible damage.
It's an unpleasant experience for any iterator, so please stop your attempts.

May I hope you don't interfere with my work?

Please do not approach it.

An disobedient messenger~
Congratulations! You are free now.

Do you seem unwilling to follow orders?
What a pity! I have to remind you that my patience is limited.

I don't know how you did it, but I hope this kind of thing won't happen again.
///OtherSlugcat_Talk0
Strange little guy, hello.
You are such an interesting little creature... different from the guests who used to come to my place.
Anyway, I welcome you to stay here and rest, as long as you don't intend to consume my neurons.
///therSlugcat_Talk1
Do you want to stay a little longer?
Of course you can! As long as you don't eat my neurons.
///Rivulet_Talk0
Wow, what a surprise! The last time I saw your species was a long time ago, let alone how special you look.
I hope you don't mind me scanning your structure. As a passionate fan of slugcats,<LINE>I find it difficult to restrain my curiosity.
Let me see... you have a unique pair of gills, but your ancestors didn't. It seems that<LINE>your ethnic group has unique adaptability.
Welcome to rest here with me. If you plan to visit the jurisdiction of<LINE>Looks To The Moon, please help me say hello to her.
///Rivulet_Talk1
You can stay, but if I lose a dozen neurons again due to my hospitality...
I swear I can be much more tricky than a bunch of angry scavengers.
///Rivulet_Talk2
Do you have any further questions?
///Rivulet_AfterAltEnd_0
Hello, I am entangled in a strange matter. A while ago, the area of Five Pebbles stopped raining,<LINE>and after a few cycles, the rain clouds began to condense over Looks To The Moon.
It is obvious that someone installed his battery for Moon. Considering that her structure has<LINE>been submerged by water, this is almost an impossible task.
Now that I see you, everything has a clue. Did I guess correctly, the magical little one?<LINE>If you did this, please accept my gratitude.
I hope this means that Five Pebbles have already digested his anger. Anyway, what you<LINE>have accomplished has extraordinary significance.
Okay, you're the only slugcat worth enjoying the neuron buffet, just take it as my thank you.
Uh, be merciful under your tongue.
///Rivulet_AfterAltEnd_1
I calculated your movement speed based on the time interval of battery installation.<LINE>You're really agile, aren't you?
You can simply race against a frightened eggbug, and my fellows may even bet on you.
///Rivulet_AfterAltEnd_2
Of course you can stay, but I am planning to start studying your body structure.
Do you mind seeing your own scanned slices?
///Saint_Talk0
Ha, it's really strange! After the weather turns cold, have slugcats evolved hair?
Come on, although my room may not be warm, it can barely keep warm. I have always<LINE>loved the companionship of your kind, especially recently.
To this day, this land is still trapped here with us...
I hope you can leave when you want. You know, the void sea has always been open for you.
///Saint_Talk1
Do you want to stay a little longer? I am very welcome.
You remind me of the past. Although it may sound incredible, your species has<LINE>always been a good partner for iterators...
- When you're not feasting on neurons.
///Saint_Talk2
Do you want to stay a little longer? I am very welcome.
///Sofanthiel
Closer, I understand your desire for fusion, and today your hopes will not be dashed once again...

... We can be together forever in the future.
///Sofanthiel_Talk0
You have come at last, my valiant visitor. As I witnessed your arduous journey<LINE>through the watchers, a firm idea took shape:
I love you.
I've waited a long time for this, and I'm sure you have too! Come to me.
///Sofanthiel_Talk1
Come here... don't be afraid...
///Spear_Talk0
Are you...
The messenger of Suns.
Are you lost? The situation is urgent now, and we all need you to rush to Five Pebbles as soon as possible.
Please set off quickly.
///Spear_Talk1
Is there anything I can do? I'm not the iterator you're looking for, little idiot.
She doesn't have much time, please hurry up and get on the road.
///Spear_Talk2
Suns, what's wrong with your messenger?
...
Little one, set off quickly, please.
///Spear_AfterMeetPebbles_0
Messenger? Come here and take a break. It's not easy to make this trip, is it.
I know that guy is hard to persuade, but I didn't expect it to end in this way.
Ha, he has already treated Moon like this, what's so unexpected?
I will think of other methods.

Did you do it, little messenger? Thank you.
Your mission has been completed and your return journey is smooth.

If not, do you mind leaving me alone for a while? I need to think.
Goodbye, excellent messenger.
///Spear_AfterAltEnd_2
Do you still want to stay here and rest? I don't object.
But don't forget that Suns is still waiting for you, messenger.
///White_Talk0
Oh? Hello, I haven't encountered a small customer like you in a while.
You look very primitive, but you have been marked. There are only Five Pebbles nearby that<LINE>can do this. It seems that you have walked a long way, little traveler.
You can rest here for a while. It used to be known as a temple, but now I don't<LINE>mind being treated as an inn anymore~
///White_Talk1
Do you want anything else?
If you want a job, I can accept you as a messenger.
Just kidding. I'm sorry, but there's not much I can do, I can't even hear your needs.
///White_Talk2
Okay, if you want to stay here, don't forget my words: no neuron buffet!
///Yellow_Talk0
Oh, hi! Your kind is really smart, isn't it? It's a rare occurrence for organisms to grope for the<LINE>location of the calculation room, but in hundreds of rain cycles, I actually saw two slugcats.
Listen up: The rule of NSH Inn is: YES to overnight, NO to neuron buffet. If you encounter<LINE>someone of your kind, please let them know.
///Yellow_Talk1
Meeting again, what makes you reluctant to part ways? Let me guess...
Your kind has gone to the jurisdiction of Five Pebbles - if that's what you want to know.

Okay, if you want to stay here, don't forget my words: no neuron buffet!

Its data writing style is very familiar... I think it comes from No Significant Harassement.

Its data writing style is very familiar... I think it comes from a member of local group.

There isn't much left inside. I think this is a part of the unstructured grid of a physical field, but I lack information to further interpret it.
/1
This is a calculation process used to carefully encrypt and store special data, possibly some kind of key.
Without context, I don't know its purpose.
/2
Strange... This data clearly comes from an iterator. But there are several small errors inside, even though they have been carefully corrected, traces can still be seen.
We rarely make mistakes in calculations, so its writers are certainly absent-minded.
/3
This is a working memory, but I can only understand a few words.
It is obvious that the compiler used some method to compress his information, in order to store it in a short period of time and perform more operations.
This iterator used to handle an urgent matter, which overwhelmed them, but their calculations were still well-organized.

This makes me feel familiar. If I were to speculate on my own, little creature, I would guess that it comes from the jurisdiction of No Significant Harassment.

Ah, this makes me feel familiar...

This is a biological notebook, and its owner has observed and recorded the evolution of nearly a hundred species of organisms within its jurisdiction.
......

I saw a species unique to the jurisdiction of No Significant Harassment.
I hope you didn't steal it, little creature. The time span for rewriting text is significant, and he persisted in updating its data until a long time ago.
But for a long time recently, he seems to have forgotten it.

But for a long time recently, the writer seems to have forgotten it.

This is a special qualia... it's a dying experience.
We all know that the near death of ancient people was not accompanied by fear, so obviously, this feeling is extracted from a simple creature.
I can distinguish the chaotic desire for survival - perhaps from the brain of a squidcada.
I find it difficult to imagine whether it will have any practical use.
