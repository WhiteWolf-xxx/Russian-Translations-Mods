Ancients once lived there, even before my structure came to be? A harsh place to inhabit, by any measure.
Though their creation for me was rushed built quickly for some experiment whose purpose eludes me.
Perhaps someone I once knew understands the reason, but for reasons I cannot fathom, I am unable to reach them.
...
They could not bear staying atop the superstructure.
The blizzards... relentless, unforgiving.

I understand why they chose to live below.
But down there, they faced another risk. 
The pests. The hostile creatures.

I can only hope they are safe.
