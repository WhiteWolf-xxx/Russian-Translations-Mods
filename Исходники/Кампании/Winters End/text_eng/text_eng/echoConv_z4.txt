A unique beast...
You wander without the ties that bound you.
Trial upon trial endless cycles, yet none succeed.

They sought freedom beyond this prison of time.
Machines churning, minds unraveling, purpose crumbling.
Their experiments failed... echoes remain.

There is another way to free,
But only time will reveal if you endure.
