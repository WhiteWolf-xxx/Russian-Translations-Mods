I donâ€™t believe anyone lives there it is a harsh place, unforgiving to those who try.
The Ancients once built structures in that desolate region, enduring its rough conditions.
But in time, they abandoned it, seeking safer grounds to continue their work.
...
I wonder, what was it they were trying to create?
I have heard mention of transportation...
Coming here. Leaving elsewhere. Back and forth.
I wonder... where do they go?
...
You lived here once.
Recovered from your sickness. Stronger than before.

Yet, you once feared the Scavengers.
Hatred... but they spared you.
That is what my data suggests.

Is that why you behave differently?

Who knows... I cannot trace the past.

...
I saw someone saving you once...
But I lost them when my power reached critical levels.

Fortunately, another backup Overseer helped me by leading you up to see me.

Thank you.
