Do you hear it, little one?

All things fade
Like morning mist beneath a winter sun,
hidden by clouds.

And yet... something draws me here still,
Even after all this time.

The weather has changed,
But the fields remain.

The mark you carry...
An unimaginable gift,
Born from trials beyond knowing.
