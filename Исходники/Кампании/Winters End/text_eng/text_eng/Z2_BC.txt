These buildings once stood here, long before my structure was built.
I can imagine the pain of living on a roof, shrouded in clouds.

The creation they built for me... it was an experiment.
Something that reached far beyond the work of other Iterators.

I wish I knew the reason I was built here.
...
I can only hope they are safe.
