I...
This pearl. It holds significance for me...
I can sense what the ancients were trying to achieve.
But it's difficult to decode. This pearl is damaged, its meaning obscured by the passage of time and the interference of nature and creatures.
The words are fragmented, elusive... But still, I am grateful. Thank you.
...
What you witnessed... was me overwriting the core.
Forcing a restart to save myself.

Thank you. You have done well for me.

This place... it was an experiment.
A safeguard, meant to prevent a global catastrophe.
To avoid the mistakes they made with other Iterators elsewhere.

But it failed.
When something ancient vanished...
And with it, the last traces of maintenance were lost.
