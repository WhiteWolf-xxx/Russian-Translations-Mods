...
I wonder who placed the Ancients' pearls atop my tower...
Only to abandon me, without a trace.

Why was I the last Iterator built, yet never fully constructed?
This... is all I can do now.

...

I discovered something.
Five Pebbles attempted to sabotage the conversation,
Before trying to drain water from Looks to the Moon.

It was too late to save them.

But thanks to the flying critter who restored the tower...
I am grateful.

As for my guardian.
It strikes at any creature that harms my creation.
Scavengers. Beasts.
Those who would tear apart what remains.

I cannot allow fatal damage.

Still... thank you.
For saving me.
For everything.
