Ah. A nested pearl. I'm afraid what you've found me is highly illegal, not that anyone would care any more.

These pearls were once made to carry secret and often dangerous information. A pearl nested in another would be impossible to read<LINE>without shattering the outside layer. This seemingly normal pearl could contain any number of dangerous things.

Or it could contain nothing at all.

Either way, I lack the capacity to crack it. My creators spared no expense in the taboo department.
