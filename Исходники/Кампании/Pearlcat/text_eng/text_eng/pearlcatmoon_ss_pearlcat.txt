What a curious pearl - it does not contain any meaningful data, but the lattice is extremely pure.

Ah, this might require a small lecture on the specifics of a pearl's data structure! But I will make it brief...

Information is etched into the pearl, very finely - it is an incredibly dense and robust form of storage;

The purer a pearl, the finer the etchings - the more data it can store, at the cost of its lifespan.

Forgive my oversimplification, but this pearl possesses extremely intricate etchings - a rarity in this day and age.

I wonder where you found this, <PlayerName>? It must have been made very recently...

...oh? There appears to be a little more on here even, actually. Such little data, it was almost unnoticeable...

It is a... oh... I see where you found this now...

I would hold onto this <PlayerName> - the scavengers would not appreciate its beauty as we do.
