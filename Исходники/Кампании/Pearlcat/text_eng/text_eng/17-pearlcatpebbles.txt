This contains information about the nearby aquifer. It is dated to sometime during my planning phase.

If it wasn't already obvious by the torrential downpours that plague this world, water is critical to our function.<LINE>A large portion of computation is performed via primitive microbes. As organics, without a steady supply of water, they accumulate slag.<LINE>Enough accumulates and our processes seize; to cut it short, the end is death. It is not a painless process, either.

Can you see why water is so precious to us now? Early on, to accommodate our enormous needs, positioning was everything.

But given enough time, and enough of us, the atmosphere would become almost completely saturated by our output, leading to torrential rainfall just about everywhere.<LINE>Our creators would, of course, exploit this outcome, choosing to build us wherever they saw fit.

Towards the end, we were mostly likely built out of habit, rather than any driving need. Perhaps my creators had found their own selfish solution, and were simply passing the time until the end.
