Curious.

This pearl seems to contain an incredible amount of static electricity. The more I peer into it, the more the energy grows.

Was this perhaps built as some kind of makeshift battery, to draw power from nearby wires? I can't imagine what use it would be, to you or its makers.

Please take this pearl with you when you leave. Although insignificant, this pearl has an irritating effect on my processes.
