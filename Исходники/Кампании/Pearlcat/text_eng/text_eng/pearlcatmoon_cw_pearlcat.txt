Oh, what a rare find! Strange scholar, this pearl was made very recently.

Did you know that it is somewhat possible to determine who made a pearl, simply by the subtle differences in its craftsmanship?

With that said, I really wonder where you found this: it doesn't look like Five Pebbles' handiwork.

Furthermore, it's full of little specks of gold... ah, perhaps sulfur impurities?

...oh dear, I know of only one member of the local group whom was built near a sulfur deposit - far from an ideal location.

Did Grey Wind give this to you...? I can't imagine the journey there and back - I'm grateful to see you here in one piece!

I am also glad to know they are still alive out there, despite what this pearl entails about their current state...

It appears to contain ritualistic chants, from a time before our conception - no surprise, Grey Wind was always quite fond of their archives!

I would definitely keep a hold of this, strange scholar - it must have meant a lot to them if they gifted it to you.
