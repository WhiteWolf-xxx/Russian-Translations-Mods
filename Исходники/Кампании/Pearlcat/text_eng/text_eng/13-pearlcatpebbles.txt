Ah, you found this in the memory crypts? I would advise against wandering into such<LINE>secure areas. The memory crypts were considered sacred ground by my creators.

The memories and wealth of entire family houses were laid to rest within, and their destruction or theft<LINE>by surface creatures was considered abhorrent. As such, the crypts are guarded by extremely durable and<LINE>aggressive purposed organisms.
