Hm... this one is perhaps a little uncomfortable to hold, the excitations are disrupting my systems ever-so slightly.

Ah, I should explain; it seems to be a conduit for retransmitting electric signals, somehow.

I have no idea where you could've found this - it's not a part of any know schematic I am aware of!

I'm happy for you to have this one back - an interesting find though.
