Oh... what do we have here?

This is fascinating, the data here consists of a singular audio track.

I have found myself collecting and archiving ancient artifacts from the time when my benefactors were still roaming this land.

This would be a great asset in my collection, there is a lot to uncover here!

Ah... but it is yours, after all. You best keep it: this is a great find, small scholar.
