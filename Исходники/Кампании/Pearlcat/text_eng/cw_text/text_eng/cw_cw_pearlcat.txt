Ah, this is the pearl I just gave you! I do hope you are not trying to return it...

The contents mean a lot to me - it's a ritualistic chant from the ancients who were native to the island I now reside on.

A relic from before our conception! Isn't it incredible?

Ah... though I can't blame you, I don't suppose it holds the same weight to your kind.

And I must apologize for the sulfur impurities, it's hard to do anything without the stuff getting everywhere...

Still, I do hope you hold onto it - I used to be quite protective of my archives, but now?

Well, there aren't exactly many people I can share this with anymore...
