Oh, this pearl was made very recently, I think! It's still warm...

It seems to have been made with some care, the structure is particularly clean.

Five Pebbles' craftsmanship, if I were to guess? It would only make sense given his relative proximity.

Back when the communication networks were functioning properly, he would occasionally share his work - pearl formation being one of his hobbies.

I must admit, it is fulfilling to finally see one in-person, evidently he hasn't lost his passion for cultural archiving, even after all this time.

If I recall correctly, he also took pride in hiding little messages within these... at least that is what Moon would say.

As far as I can tell this one is blank, though I never had an eye for details like Moon did...
