Very strange! This one seems to possess self-healing properties.

I would suspect it employs the use of microbes, as do many self-healing structures our creators built.

This proves abundantly useful for conventional structures, self-healing concrete in particular is quite widespread.

In fact, it is the only reason the vast majority of structures have been able to withstand our output after all this time.

But for a pearl to use the same mechanism...? It's news to me!

Things like this, they make me wonder... just how much am I missing, trapped within this can?
