Oh, how fun! This is a nested pearl, considered rather illegal for us to possess: they typically conceal dangerous or sensitive information.

In order to read this, metaphorically speaking, I would first have to break its outer shell - an action one of my taboos forbids.

Our creators believed that some information would be better concealed from us, it seems.

And now, even after they are long gone, neither of us can know what is on this... what a shame!
