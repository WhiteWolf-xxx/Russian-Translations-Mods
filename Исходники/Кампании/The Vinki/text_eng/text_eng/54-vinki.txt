It is the genome for a purposed organism. A small slug to clean the insides of pipes. I believe I told<LINE>you that your kind evolved from one of those? Well, it is likely that this blueprint has a part in your<LINE>origin!

You are lucky your ancestors had such complex structures despite their purpose, as most purposed<LINE>organisms barely looked like organisms at all. More like tubes in metal boxes, where something went in<LINE>one end and something else came out the other.

There were of course those that were purposed for spectacle rather than industry - they enjoyed the<LINE>privilege of glass boxes. Or, well... silly glasses and magnetic shoes, for those more lucky ones.

When I came into this world there was very little primal fauna left. That is why I believe your family<LINE>might have come from one of these.
