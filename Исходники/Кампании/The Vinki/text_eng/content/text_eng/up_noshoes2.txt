You start your futile attempt to shred downhill, but the only thing you really shred are your feet.
Burning pain hits you while you leave a trail of blood on the pole behind you.
At some point you trip and fall the rest of the way, hitting the ground with your shoulder.
There is no way a slugcat can survive such hell, but in the last seconds of your life you can hear
"Bruh that was a buzz kill LLLLL"
