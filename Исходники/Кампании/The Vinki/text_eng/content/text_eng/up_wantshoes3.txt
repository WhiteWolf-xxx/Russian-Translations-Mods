As cycles pass by unnoticeably you sit there waiting for those shoes to get right in your hands.
After a decent amount of time you started feeling cold.
It started snowing, but you don't care, because now there is only one thing you need in this world:
A pair of fancy blue shoes that let you shred on any rail you find.
But it doesn't seem like you will be able to get those shoes at all because the superstructure you were sitting on suddenly collapsed.
