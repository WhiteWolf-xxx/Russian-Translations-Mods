You follow the slugcat down a corridor and find yourself in a large square room. 
There's a god-like robot suspended in the middle of the room.
"Yo, wassup Five Pebsi? I brought a new homie who is seriously cracked with art skills!"
"Oh, for the love of- Did I not tell you to leave and never return? Whatever, 
let's just get this over with, so you can leave me in peace."
"No problemo, Five Peppinos! Yo, bud, peep how this no-gravity geek flips when he sees this!"

Observe.
