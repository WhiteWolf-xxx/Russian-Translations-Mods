...is this reaching you?|
A young animal on the floor around my chamber. I think I know what you are looking for.|
You're stuck in a cycle, a repeating pattern. You want a way out.|
The good news first. As a gift of charity from my creators to this world, I am aware of the ecosystems enclosed within my facility.<LINE>You are an outsider. You do not belong here.|
East past the shore, past the channel that separates your world from mine lies the rest of your subspecies.|
A tunnel connects these two coastlines. Go east, beyond the Garbage Wastes, and deep into the remains of my neighbour's structure.|
The bad news is that in your particular situation, the bonds that tether you to this world are too great.<LINE>Even with the assistance of a god such as myself, you would remain unable to pass through to the spiritual realm.|
If for some inane reason you still believe that you could break free from your cycle, your solution lies deep beneath my structure, where the land fissures.|
Not that my assistance solves anyone's problem but yours.|
Best of luck to you, young creature. I must resume my work.|
