Your kind is a rare sight here. And what is that I see? You seem to be aware of my presence, too!

Little creature on the collapsed bridge below, what do you here?<LINE>You have a purpose as well? Or did you just gather yourself to take in the beauty<LINE>that the world has to offer?

Perhaps, this can be a purpose too in one's eyes. Maybe I had one too, some ages ago.

I remember little from who I once was. Or rather I should say what I once was. Perhaps I even<LINE>envy you, little one.

Will you do me a favor? My purpose, whatever it was - do it in my place.

It is not an order, not it is a plea. A simple offering, of someone lowly enough to deserve<LINE>this suffering to someone who still follows the cycle. I have nothing to offer in return.

But even so, isn't being alive already a gift, in a twisted sense of way?<LINE>Or did eons of solitude destroy my mind enough to consider the cycle a kind gesture from the world?
