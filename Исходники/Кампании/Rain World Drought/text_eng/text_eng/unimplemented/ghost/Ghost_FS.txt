You are not from around here, are you, little creature?

I cannot recall what is it that I forgot here, yet here I am.<LINE>You must think of me quite lowly...

I cannot go, something holds me here.<LINE>Did I forget something important?

Through and after countless cycles, these lands have eroded into a faded silhouette of what it once was.<LINE>I can recognize this place no longer.

I steered away from my wonts, I lost my name, I cannot recall the words of high.<LINE>Is my time here a punishment, or a remembrance?

I want to go.<LINE>But until then - walk the lands in my place, little creature.
