This is a jellyfish!

These jellyfish are hibernating when out of water, but a small impact from a throw is enough to wake them up,<LINE>if for a moment. They get scared, and release electricity, though it's not deadly...

I can't recall everything Seven Red Suns told me though - I archived most of the blabber he told me<LINE>in the pearls. You could ask him more about the fauna yourself - he created you, after all.

As for this jellyfish... I think your kind eats them, but look out for its stingers.<LINE>The stingers are very much active even now, surely you don't want to hurt yourself?
