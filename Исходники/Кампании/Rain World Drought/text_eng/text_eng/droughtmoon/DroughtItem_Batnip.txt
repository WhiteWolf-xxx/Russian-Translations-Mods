This is a herb, it's also slightly dry. I'm not sure what else to tell.

Oh! My analyses pick up a sweet aroma, so perhaps this is some sort of a tea plant? I'm stretching the possibilities<LINE>here, but I truly don't know what to say, sorry! Where did you find it?

The monks used to grow plenty of various plants, vegetables and fruits on their farms, especially<LINE>various herbs for cooking. Spices were popular, but not mentioned very often. But most important of them<LINE>all were tea leaves. Those monks who followed old rituals needed them for sustenance - it was the only thing that kept<LINE>them going as they prepared for ascension!

Maybe that's what this plant is? I'm grasping at straws here, but it's always fun to theorize.<LINE>It does smell wonderful! According to my analyses, anyway.
