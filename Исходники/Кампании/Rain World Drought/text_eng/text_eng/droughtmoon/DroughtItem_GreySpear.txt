Well, I'm not sure what exactly it is. Of course I saw you wield it, but it's not a "spear" in your common sense. What<LINE>you usually use for a weapon is simple rebar. A piece of support construct, broken off of a building long ago and scattered<LINE>around by rain.

This... thing, it isn't uniform enough, isn't strong enough and I think it isn't even made of metal. Or anything<LINE>like that, either. I think this is actually organic? Perhaps a quill of sorts? A bone?

I'm sorry <PlayerName>, I can't tell you for certain. I'll try to analyze it, though, when I have the time.
