It looks like a rock, but it's quite light. How mysterious.<LINE>Well, in truth, however, this is merely a nut,<LINE>that is produced from a single ovary of a flowering plant. Or, rather a berry? The semantics are lost on me, I won't lie.

It's quite dry, too. I'll go ahead and assume that it grows in dry places, but requires water to plump up and<LINE>spread the seeds around for a more successful propagation? It almost feels like a trivia test from Suns! I wonder<LINE>if I got my analysis sorted out correctly.

Well, you can have it back. I'll go ahead and assume that you aren't going to delve into agriculture<LINE>and try to grow that, so... feel free to eat it. Just don't forget to wet it beforehand!<LINE>You'll have to leave my can, however. No water here, as you know.
