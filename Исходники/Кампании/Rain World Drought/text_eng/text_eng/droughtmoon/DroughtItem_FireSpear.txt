Oh dear, this is an outright weapon! Not even a makeshift one. Or, well... It is makeshift by definition, but...<LINE>Never mind, <PlayerName>.

I must apologize, I'm just at a loss of words! First of all - this is a very dangerous spear. Where did you get it? Who made that?<LINE>I vaguely remember seeing these spears before on scavengers, but I've never seen these being actually made.<LINE>Allow me to explain, alright?

So, unless you already used one of these before,- you should know that this spear can explode. Violently!<LINE>The tip is wrapped in some sort of a cloth, and under it is a "holder" of sorts, woven out of plant fibers? I cannot recognize the plant itself,<LINE>but there is flammable powder inside that "holder".

Flammable powder is... something of a myth? If I may say so. It's something I've heard only once or twice<LINE>of, and I have no memory of what it was called, but "fire powder" was something of a taboo among monks, I'd imagine.<LINE>It's hard to say for sure, considering the majority of their chit-chats were either rituals or their own needs and plans, nothing much<LINE>else.

I'm simply surprised to see this here, because... Well, not only is it made<LINE>with something quite forbidden in my parents' history and unheard of, even, but it's also fashioned as something you would<LINE>see on ancient murals of one of the great Sins. It's like seeing an artifact from ages past, except I'm also holding it!<LINE>Fascinating.
