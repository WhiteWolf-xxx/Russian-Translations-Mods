It's an active working memory - raw data has been dropped here in order to later be<LINE>stored into a currently occupied memory conflux. Without context it's just a jumble. 
It is the impression of being a small creature, like a wall climbing lizard, looking <LINE>up into the branches of a big tree. The last third is partly overwritten with a number <LINE>series I vaguely recognize, I think Moon sent it to me at some point.
Seven... intertwined number series? Is this some sort of a... <LINE>Might be a key for a cipher processor, customized for some other data which is impossible to infer from this.
An active working memory. Without knowing where this was cut from or where it's to be stored to, <LINE>it is not really possible to decipher it. If I had to guess, I would say it has something to <LINE>do with trance inducing number series. 
You really shouldn't take these pearls from Looks to the Moon.<LINE>She needs them for her work. This one is her active working memory. I don't know the context, though.
Without the process surrounding this data there isn't much I can tell you.
This one is filled with short excerpts from Moon's researches.<LINE>Very old stuff in this one, but I assume she's still storing them for possible future explorations. 
Hey, I recognize this data! Moon sent it to me a few thousand cycles ago.<LINE>Did you take this from Moon? Of course you did, never mind.
Did you take this from Looks to the Moon?<LINE>This one is filled with her short essays on grandeur of our ancestors.<LINE>Strange, but they were her life, I can understand that.
Inside this pearl are 8 different poems and mantras, dating back to the times of Blue dynasty. For some<LINE>reason each poem is marked with a name of an iterator from local group.<LINE>My name goes with the poem labeled as "Between and Betwixt". Well, her mind is a mystery to me.
This one has 885 various synonyms to the word "cycle". All of them are qualia, not words.
A sacred text, automatically read at the start of every cycle. It's a ritual the monks performed with sunrise,<LINE>and one she follows too. At least I'm assuming she would.
Interesting. This pearl has a picture of you, <PlayerName>, and in very high detail. She even correctly<LINE>analyzed the structure of your tail's kinetic wire engine. Perhaps, Moon is finally interested in<LINE>some creature-oriented work? I'll be happy to guide her!
This is a saved state of an unfinished process. This version dates back 2 cycles, so Moon<LINE>probably won't be looking for something so old anymore.
It's a high resolution picture of some sort of mold growing on a corpse of a lizard.<LINE>I don't know if it's a new type of flora - ask Suns later. I wonder why Moon has it...
This pearl is filled to the brim with jumbled mess. I could try to run some analyses on it, but I'm sure<LINE>without the process itself around it - I won't be able to make out anything sensible.<LINE>This isn't a working memory, mind you. This is a deliberate jumbled mess, I simply can't see anything of meaning in it.
A recent scan of a memory conflux. Seems a bit rundown, but far from a critical state.
Moon's collection of mantras. This one seems to be a bit old - not that there are new ones appearing, but<LINE>I just know she keeps making copies in case she loses some.
Oh. Oh, wow, I thought that was impossible for Moon, but... Well, that explains why the room was ejected so savagely.<LINE>This pearl holds a report on some experiment going extremely awry. Luckily, almost all iterators can rearrange their rooms as needed, so<LINE>whatever Moon's experiment was - it wasn't fast or deep enough to make her suffer any significant damages.
