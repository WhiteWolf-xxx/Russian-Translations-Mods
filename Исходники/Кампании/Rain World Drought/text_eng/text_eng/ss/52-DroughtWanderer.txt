Ah, you broke it. Or, well, perhaps it wasn't you. Doesn't matter now, it's not too big of a loss.

This thing you brought is a destroyed overseer. Overseers are a complex mechanism of self-rearranging<LINE>tubes, diodes and wires, powered by a single drop of void fluid. Even that is enough to keep them working for many, many cycles. One<LINE>could even outlive you, that's how effective they are at converting void fluid to energy.

20 : 20 : Overseers are smart on their own, so I don't take control over any. But it's possible, if needed... Although the range<LINE>of connection is abysmal, I'd have more luck bringing a bunch of them onto my can and taking a large photo from up here, than having to<LINE>guide one over ground.

Well, fixing this won't really do much, I have too many overseers already. So... why don't you<LINE>take it back? You can trade it in with scavengers. Or...<LINE>I can't think of any other use for it, but I'm sure you'll need it for something.
