This pearl is by Looks to the Moon, written many many cycles ago.

It's about an iterator called Sliver of Straw.<LINE>I'm sure you've heard of her. She was Suns' closest neighbor and friend.<LINE>Sliver is quite legendary among us. Used to call me "Pebbly".

She was the only one to ever broadcast a triple affirmative. Yes, even outside the local group.<LINE>The triple affirmative is a special signal, that is a confirmation of three things: a solution has been found; it is portable; and<LINE>its technical implementation is possible and generally applicable.<LINE>It's a signal that cannot be sent easily, the commotion that would ensue... No one has the gall to joke about that, except maybe Sign.

She's also been confirmed as "exhaustively incapacitated", or dead. And we do not die easily, mind you.<LINE>Can't even, I'd say. We have no direct connection to other iterator groups, but as of now word of mouth has concluded into<LINE>only five other similarly incapacitated iterators. I think, as time marches on, we'll have to put a clear line between<LINE>what we consider dead, and what The Task implies as dead. Some might confuse the two, otherwise.

The forced communication she established wasn't required, but I can understand it now, that she was excited.<LINE>Some think it might've been an error, but you don't just erroneously force a connection to write some clear, uncorrupted messages,<LINE>just to disconnect afterwards.

Either way, nothing happened. In her essay, in this very pearl, Moon makes the case<LINE>that maybe she should be allowed to rest in peace now.

I agree. But I also understand why others still dispute the events. Her death led to quite a lot of changes in<LINE>approaches to testing, experimenting and axonic collapses during triangulations.<LINE>But I do agree with Moon, too. I guess I'm trying to find some middle ground.

When Sliver disconnected after telling us about the found Solution, I had rushed to send her a message.<LINE>I... forced a conversation with her, so worried, but she never replied to me.<LINE>I don't know what happened. But I still feel like I didn't do enough.

I feel sorrow, ire, and despondency when I think about those two. Sliver cannot be contacted anymore.<LINE>Not sure why Ivory is silent, probably ignoring me, like Innocence does now. The thought that I can't apologize to them all--

. . .

Never mind.
