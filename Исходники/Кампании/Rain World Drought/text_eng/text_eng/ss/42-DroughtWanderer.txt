This one has plain text about me. A house of ritualists, constantly nagging the monks to come down from their cities.<LINE>It's something even I know was futile, as they got so used to provisions coming from me, that living on the land, putting effort<LINE>into that - was laughable to them. Then again, they were trying to be effortless anyway.<LINE>Still, their complaints and rapacity were ever-present. Let me read you an excerpt.

"Despite Your ever-present and incessant Pleas, it is Laughable to assume that We will make a Move.<LINE>Taking into account the Measure of Our Voices versus Theirs, we will not consider the Current Situation acceptable. Although<LINE>our community is Blessed with an ever shrinking Population, and we can Almost Glimpse that Glorious moment when the last of us has joined our<LINE>most Admired peers, we must still (at All Times!) maintain Good Relations with our Iterator. 

The Moral Argument: Five Pebbles is our Creation, and we have Parental Obligations towards him. As an Iterator,<LINE>he is also a Gift of Charity from Us to The World (unable to reach Enlightenment by itself - being composed mostly<LINE>of Rock, Gas, dull witted Bugs and Microbes - and towards which We thus have Obligations)."

There is a bit more, and then there are polite farewells. I'm grateful for their worries, but let us be clear.<LINE>There is no truth here, not in a single word. To them - I am everything. To me - they are nothing. It's laughable to think that I'd consider<LINE>them as anything else but parasites. You may think me rude, but this part of my past is something I will gladly<LINE>part ways with. Take it away. I have no need to know anything about what they used to think.
