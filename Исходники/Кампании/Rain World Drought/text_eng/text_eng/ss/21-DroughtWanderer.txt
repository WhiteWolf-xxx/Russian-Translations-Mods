This is a part of an Iterator conversation group, Sliver of Ocean. Only two from our local group<LINE>actually joined this conversation at the time. We're a closed bunch, some call us Sliverists, but there are many groups<LINE>like ours, I'm sure. It's an umbrella term, anyway. I wonder who came up with it...

I don't think there's a point to reading all of it to you. Just musings of a tired god,<LINE>looking for another way around the problem. Luckily, to explore this path - we have you, <PlayerName>.
