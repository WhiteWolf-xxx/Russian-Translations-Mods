This is a living egg with some growth inside. And it's quite close to hatching, it seems! I can feel the outer<LINE>membrane throbbing with life. You aren't planning to hatch these in here, are you, <PlayerName>?

You should leave it outside, so they don't hatch in my can. I'd prefer whatever these creatures are out of here, and<LINE>not rummaging through my spaces or toasting themselves on my coils. You could say I care for the young, but I'm simply being practical.<LINE>I've never really developed that notorious "care for the young" that monks mentioned here and there as one of the sins.

In general, I've never seen any young ones on my can. I know nothing of the life cycles of my<LINE>creators, though, so perhaps it's normal.
