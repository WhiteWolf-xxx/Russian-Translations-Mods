This is a hallucinogenic mushroom. It is not edible, but a few shouldn't hurt you.<LINE>Just, don't eat too many.

One of my... One of iterators, Halcyon Frequency, tried to use these mushrooms to create a purposed organism.<LINE>You know, one that would be in a constant hallucinogenic state, with heightened senses and reflexes.

I'm not sure it went well. Imagine trying to escape the cycles, but everything is slowed down around you.<LINE>The maddening slowdown that makes you suffer for twice as long.<LINE>Maybe that creature tried to die, only to be reborn over and over and over and over and over again.<LINE>We're all suffering, of course, but who knows how much that one suffered already.

. . .

I think I spoke too much. This isn't true, of course. After all, the only thing Halcyon mentioned about such an<LINE>experiment is that it wasn't successful. The rest is purely my imagination. Don't think about it too hard, <PlayerName>, I tend to wander<LINE>in deep thoughts sometimes. Here, take it back - and go.
