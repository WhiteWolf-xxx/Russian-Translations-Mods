Hmm... How peculiar. This is a shell stuffed with explosive powder.<LINE>Scavengers? Most likely.

I haven't seen any of their inventions, but the rains below are simply too strong to keep anything intact for long.<LINE>This explosive powder is quite an interesting discovery, that they made on their own, I'm sure of that. Just how<LINE>developed is their kind? I can't help but wonder...

Here, take this away, and be careful. I recommend staying away from it when you throw it. It's powerful enough<LINE>to knock you out cold even from afar, not to mention it'll outright kill you if it explodes nearby.
