Inside this pearl is a genetic sequence for a haploid micro-organism, and a subsequent genome for a larger creature, based<LINE>on aforementioned cells. Some kind of a crawling creature, it seems. It's clearly based on some primal fauna, that is most likely<LINE>extinct now.

I don't think it's of any use to me... Although perhaps it could be useful to scour<LINE>for any slag, that is overdue to be cleaned.

Creating purposed creatures isn't my forte, though I've dabbled into it before, and can now, too.<LINE>Although the way we create them now and the way our creators used to make them is drastically different.

I'm not sure if there are many purposed organisms left, especially created by the monks. They can live for<LINE>a very long time, but they need support. Without it... well, life finds a way to escape containment and evolve outside its<LINE>boundaries into something new. I am looking at one such creature right now, after all.
