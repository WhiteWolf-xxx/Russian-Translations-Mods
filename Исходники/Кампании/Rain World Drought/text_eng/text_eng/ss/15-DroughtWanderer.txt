It's the blueprint for a Void Fluid filtration system.<LINE>I think you might remember what Void Fluid is, right <PlayerName>?

Hmmm, how do I explain it to you...<LINE>Ah, let me try something. I doubt I remember it perfectly, but it went like this...

"If you leave a stone on the ground, it will be covered in dust later. This happens<LINE>everywhere and to everything, and over several lifetimes of creatures such as you,<LINE>the ground slowly builds upwards. 

So why doesn't the ground collide with the sky? Because far down, under the very, very old layers of the earth,<LINE>the rock and everything else is being dissolved or removed.<LINE>The entity which does this is known as the Void Sea.

If you drill far enough into the earth you begin encountering a substance called Void Fluid.<LINE>The deeper you go, the less rock and more Void Fluid. It's believed that there is a point<LINE>where the rock completely gives way - below that would be the Void Sea.

When that stone you placed on the ground has finally done its time in the sediments,<LINE>it meets the Void Fluid and is dissolved, leaving the physical world."

Was this a good impression of Moon?<LINE>Verily speaking, I just repeated one of the lectures she read to me when I was first connected to the network.

The ancients figured out a way to use Void Fluid. Not only to ascend, but also as an energy source.<LINE>This brought a revolution to their then rudimentary society. Even I didn't exist back then.<LINE>The Void Fluid drills were what started the big technological leap, but this was very<LINE>long before I entered this world.

You couldn't just use it as is, however. Void Fluid had to be filtered before use - mostly because the fluid close to the bedrock<LINE>itself would contain unneeded extras. Through filtration its purity is increased, and even if it takes a long time - it's still<LINE>a better solution than simply digging down more and more. For some reason, the drills simply break, and no one knows why.<LINE>Yes, they break, not melt. The alloy was quite resistant to void fluid, it doesn't melt easily.

Ironically, only after our creators were finally gone, I started to question myself.

Where does the dust come from? Water that I evaporate from the ground comes back rushing down onto it with rain.<LINE>There is a clear cycle to it. Some random analyses have found traces of same water I used up again.<LINE>Remnants of the same microbe strata, that is unique to me and Innocence.

So what is this dust they talk about, then? Where does it come from? Chemical analyses won't tell you the origin.<LINE>Perhaps, the ancients' bodies turned into that dust. Like everything else in the void sea.<LINE>And if not - will the sea below keep rising over the eons? Will it one day consume us?

My thought processes are slagged sometimes. I apologize.
