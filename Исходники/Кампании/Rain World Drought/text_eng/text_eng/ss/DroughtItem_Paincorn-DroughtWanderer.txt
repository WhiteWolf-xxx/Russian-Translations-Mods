Ah... I don't like this.<LINE>This is just a bunch of bugs. They seemingly stick together for safety and self-defense, but right now they are<LINE>all asleep or hibernating? 

Well, let's not rouse them awake. I like to move around my can, if they wake up - I'll have to deal<LINE>with all the webs they throw around... Take it away, please. Preferably - out of my can.
