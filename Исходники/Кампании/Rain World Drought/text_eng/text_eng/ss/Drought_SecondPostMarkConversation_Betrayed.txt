And you're back.

I know I shouldn't be angry with you. After all, you couldn't have known the importance of<LINE>what you were delivering. To me, at least, it was truly vital...<LINE>Let's not think about it too hard. I am trying my best to remain calm.

Now all alone, I can't help but try and figure myself out. I just feel heavy now. And with all my knowledge I can't understand what<LINE>is it that I want to do next. If anything at all. All I can say for certain is that I am simply tired.

Perhaps, Moon was right about all this. I have been a bit hasty in my recent endeavors. I can understand<LINE>that, but I don't think I'll ever be able to truly forgive you for crossing out thousands of cycles of work, even<LINE>if you didn't mean to do that.

I suppose, we both gained something out of this.<LINE>You - a new friend. Me - a peace of mind. Even, if I lost some of my efforts.<LINE>Well, most of them.

Perhaps calling it "peace" is a misnomer, but I have a lot of time now to think about... well, everything.
