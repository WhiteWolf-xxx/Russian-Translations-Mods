Did this plant just float? Well, that just happened! I'm assuming there is air inside these orbicular caps, but...<LINE>No, actually. Some different gas. But I won't waste my time analyzing it.

Why don't you ask Seven Red Suns about it?<LINE>I wasn't made to analyze living things, even though I can. Just not to the same extent as Suns, unlike him my<LINE>initial databases were based on patches and scraps of whatever other iterators didn't need...

All I can say, and that's with a one-hundred percent certainty, is that this plant will help you stay underwater for longer.<LINE>And it looks quite lovely!
