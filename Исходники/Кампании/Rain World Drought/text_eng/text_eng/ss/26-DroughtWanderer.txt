It's a pupa of some small flying creature.<LINE>Inside are nutritions, necessary for their healthy growth. Their genomes at some point were used for<LINE>creation of old iterators' neurons. However it didn't work out, so our ancestors worked with a different genome instead.

Those bugs can live for up to 10 cycles. Perhaps you saw them flying around near my can?<LINE>Perhaps you even grabbed them to traverse bigger distances? At least I think this is the right bug.<LINE>Blue coloration is common in pupae, isn't it? I'm not Seven Red Suns - I am no master of the fauna.

Few of them survive, but they are born anew a couple of cycles later. Revived, resurrected, reincarnated.<LINE>Trapped in an infinite cycle of life and death, even though they seem to completely not mind that.<LINE>Perhaps, they have no brains to truly understand the tragedy of the situation they're in?

You can eat it, I don't mind. I have no need for it anyway.<LINE>If anything - I'd like it out of my can.
