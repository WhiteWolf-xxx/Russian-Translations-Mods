It's a weapon made with fire powder. Did the scavengers give this to you?<LINE>It could be very dangerous if used incorrectly, so be careful.

...Hmm, it makes me wonder how they make these. The scavengers, I mean. How do they make these spears?<LINE>It's so carefully crafted, wrapped twice, filled with explosive powder that was unseen for many eons and is simply impossible<LINE>to get anywhere on our plateau. Scavengers make these weapons to fend off the beasts, don't they? Or for some other reason?

I can only guess about that. But I don't have to guess that you'll find more uses for it than me.
