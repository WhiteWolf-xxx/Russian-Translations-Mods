Hmm... This pearl is very old, almost shattered on the inside.<LINE>Just holding it makes me uneasy, like I could break it was I to drop it.

Thankfully, the structural integrity doesn't concern me in this particular case.<LINE>After all - the majority of data is in the outer layer, and the core is seemingly undamaged. Let me try to read it...

SPECEVENT : DETONATE

Ah, I guess it was old enough to shatter completely just by trying to read it...

...Who am I lying to, this has never happened before! It's not even supposed to shatter just from fiddling with electrons!<LINE>What in the name of arbiter was this pearl...

That was very cryptic. I wish I could give you the pearl back, but... there's only dust now. What a shame too, and I just had<LINE>the will and free time for deciphering and analyzing, too.

<CapPlayerName>!<LINE>Don't grieve! This is where I praise you,- despite the pearl gone to ashes - you piqued my curiosity. Good work!<LINE>Maybe I could somehow restore it... Physically, at least.
