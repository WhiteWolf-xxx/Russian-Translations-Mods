It's a production record of a mask factory, its last time in service.<LINE>I doubt you have seen any bone masks. You will have to visit someplace else for a chance of that - one of iterators<LINE>in the local group perhaps still has factories standing, the oldest ones, thus touched the least. One or two might remain.

I'm not talking about simple masks of those flying monstrosities that sometimes plague my walls. No, these ones<LINE>belonged to the monks. Long ago the masks were for covering the face as a way to symbolically nullify your personality, your self.<LINE>But then, of course, our creators couldn't leave it as that - so they attached various accessories to<LINE>those masks, giving a part of their selves back.

It's quite a layered and inane concept, to cleanse yourself only to paint a new layer,<LINE>even more lush than the one before. Perhaps, they got sidetracked somewhere in history, because it sounded and still sounds silly.

This pearl comes from facility by the name of Side House. It's not too far from both me and Moon.<LINE>Side House is... or rather was a religious site, with hand-made masks created and spread from there.<LINE>Unfortunately, nothing remains of its past, as it was completely refurbished for industrial projects.
