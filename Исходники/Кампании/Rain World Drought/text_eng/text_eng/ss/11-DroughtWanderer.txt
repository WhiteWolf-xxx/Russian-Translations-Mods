Ah, that. Moon scanned it long time ago, ages after ages well into the past.<LINE>It's interesting, to say the least. Let me enlighten you.

It's a little text of spiritual guidance. Those were abound, and everyone used to zealously read them.<LINE>This one is written by a monk called Four Cabinets, Eleven Hatchets.<LINE>I have no information on them, you will have to ask Suns.<LINE>The text itself is old, several ages before the Void Fluid revolution. 

This text, like most writing from this time, is quite shrouded in analogies, but the subject is how to shed<LINE>one of the five natural urges which tie a creature to life.

It's a long poem on how you, the one who wants to ascend, should remain occluded for the remainder of your life.<LINE>Well, it's not really a poem... More of an instruction on how to starve yourself.<LINE>And how to be fine with that, grateful even.

Now, of course, when Void Fluid was discovered these methods proved obsolete, as it was<LINE>more easy just jumping in a vat of it to effortlessly leave this world behind. 

Well, I say effortlessly, even though there were stories of echoes remaining behind.<LINE>Moon would probably call them horror stories, but among the lower castes, especially in cities outside local group, it was a very believable story.

Even when the Void Fluid baths became cheaper, almost free even,<LINE>some of the ancients on my can would still lock themselves away from the world and meditate.<LINE>It was frowned upon, but with the immediate ascension of the High they were allowed to do as they please.
