It's a confirmation to an automated farming plot that a shipment of beverages has arrived.<LINE>Happened thousands of cycles ago, the scans of the confirmation are still<LINE>somewhere in my memory.

Would you like me to read it out loud to you? Not that you'd bother digging into the nuances<LINE>of the phraseology, but time with you is a nice outlet for my languor.

"On regards of the (by spiritual splendor eternally graced) people of the Congregation of Never Dwindling Righteousness,<LINE>we Wish to congratulate (o so thankfully) this Facility on its..."

Ahh, malarkey. Let me skip the needless introduction and skip to the meat of this<LINE>message. I could never understand all these drawn out pleasantries, and never will.<LINE>They weren't even coming from our creators anyway, mindlessly copied times and times again.

Where was I? Right.<LINE>"It is with Honor I, Eight Suns-Countless Leaves, of the House of Six Wagons, Count of no living blocks, Counselor of 2, Duke of 1,<LINE>Humble Secretary of the Congregation of Never Dwindling Righteousness, write this to You.<LINE>We hope that the Crops are healthy, and..."

Are you even listening, <PlayerName>?<LINE>Your small brain cannot process that much information, so perhaps this all sounds boring to you.<LINE>In no offense to you or Suns, of course. I am merely stating that it is but drivel to you.

I doubt you'll see what I see here. And don't even mention Moon. At least a percent of her memory complexes<LINE>is dedicated to these automated messages. They were written with the latest dogmas in mind, after all.<LINE>...I shall continue. Where was I?..

"Leaning on the Solid Foundation of our Long Running Fruitful and Mutually Satisfactory Cooperation, we will take the liberty of stating<LINE>The Reason for this Message ~ we write to Warmly thank You for yet Another Timely and Appreciated delivery of your Product (Nectar) to our<LINE>Community (Congregation of Never Dwindling Righteousness). Our humble Words can never Aspire to Describe our gratitude."

And then come the titles.<LINE>"Sincerely, your Appreciative and Satisfied Acquirers: Nine Snails Unhurried Turtle; Zero Flaws Many Concerns;<LINE>Four Safes Eleven Fliers; Round Apple Abreast Burnt Bread;..." Truly, the titles go on for even longer.

Once I asked Sis about the meaning behind those titles. She went on an angry reprimand, about how not a single name should<LINE>be left behind. Writer of dogmas, creators of ours, composers of automated messages. Every name was as unique<LINE>and as important to them as I am to you, as long as they had even the faintest relation to the content of this pearl.

But I never understood the reasoning behind such correctness. Little ants worried about their little things.<LINE>Only slowing themselves down by talking, writing nonsense all day long.
