Is this for me? Must be what Seven Red Suns wanted to deliver.<LINE>I have been awaiting this message.

...Oh, instructions! Finally, some sapid information on how to circumvent the taboo.

You know, <PlayerName>, the problem with breaking taboos is that the barriers are encoded<LINE>into every cell of our organic parts. And we can't rewrite it...<LINE>Not yet, at least.

Hmmm, that's interesting... I can see why Suns wanted me to test this out.<LINE>The experiment requires a specific microbiotic matter, that is only found in two iterators from our local group.<LINE>And the other option isn't a talkative type, nor is she a part of us.

This does not rewrite everything from the looks of it.<LINE>A very specific strata, a single, smallest seam on this taboo, nothing more...<LINE>I assume this is based on Sliver's past rewrites, although for mere microbes, not larger creatures.

...This will be very difficult, but I think I can give it a shot.<LINE>If Suns' multilayered triangulations showed fruitful results - then I can expect some empirical...

Oh. <PlayerName>, I forgot you were standing here.<LINE>I got too enthralled, I should apologize.

This is extremely promising, and it will require a lot of focus and work from me!<LINE>Our small group would not get that far without your help!<LINE>For now, though, you should probably go.

It will take some time before you'll be needed again, <PlayerName>. At the very least - not to me!<LINE>You deserve some rest, and the pearl will remain here, with me.<LINE>Sliver would be very proud of you, little one.<LINE>If she could, I'm sure she'd thank you as well.

I will inform Suns that you succeeded.<LINE>I'll be very busy, with a lot of preparations still to come, so try not to bother me in the meantime, alright?<LINE>If you want - visit Moon on your way back, and say hello to her for me.

Oh, actually, before you go...<LINE>I might not know much about creatures, but I'm quite knowledgeable when it comes to<LINE>energy preservation models. Last time you came here all those cycles ago,<LINE>I caught a glimpse of an erroneous sequence in your tail's axonic array.

So... I took a liberty to fix your tail while you were floating through my place.<LINE>It should be working better now. A small present, for you and Suns both.<LINE>Thank you again, <PlayerName>! You can go now, you know where the exit is. Be careful!
