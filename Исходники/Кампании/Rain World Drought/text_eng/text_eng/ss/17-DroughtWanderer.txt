Interesting. This text is about the local aquifer beneath our cans. Must've been stored by Moon, since the date is...<LINE>Well, I think at that time I was still being planned, and thus didn't exist. 

All the data on this pearl is outdated. Severely so!<LINE>Great equalizer brought enough water everywhere, and knowing how aquifers work, even in our elevation...<LINE>Not to mention the many pipes and systems specifically made later in history to supply iterators with water.

Yes, water is our most valuable resource. The first... Let's say twenty.<LINE>The first twenty iterators, as outdated in design as they might've been, were successful in one thing:<LINE>sucking water and expelling it in massive clouds of quickly cooling steam.

You know what a great equalizer is, right? The first iterators,<LINE>and nigh all others who followed, to an extent, inhale and breathe the same amount of water.<LINE>Draining aquifers, creating lakes and rivers, refilling - a cycle.

Of course that cycle also outlived itself, when all the digging sites filled the ground with pipes and tubes,<LINE>draining the water all over, and directing it elsewhere. Yet another way of our creators taking control over life.<LINE>Just don't let Moon know I said this!

I think she is a little bit wary of me being built so close. It's not uncommon of her to<LINE>often warn me about water levels and water usage approximations for her experiments. She sees it as care.<LINE>Verily, I see it as such as well, but I can also sense a hint of... different kind of care.<LINE>Either way, my saline filters and all the countless pipes bringing water from outside local group work well enough. She shouldn't worry.
