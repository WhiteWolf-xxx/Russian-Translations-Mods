Where did you find this? Oh, by the words of High.<LINE>I didn't think I'd see it again. Just another memory that I thought was thrown far away enough,<LINE>only to find it back by me, as a reminder of my mistakes.

I'm sorry, <PlayerName>. Do I sound ominous to you? Dreary? Depressed?<LINE>I might. Many things have happened in my time, and many that I regret. This pearl is<LINE>one of many. An old dialogue between me and a friend of mine. Or should I say "monologue"? It was rather one-sided.<LINE>And rude.

This particular dialogue comes from Northern Grand Ivory. He's quite a mystery, not even a part of our local group, yet somehow<LINE>able to contact me, despite sharing no communication arrays with us. However, he was a very close friend of Sliver.<LINE>She, too, was a friend of mine. The key word here is "was".

You see, Sliver... died. Well, she simply became "dynamically and functionally incapacitated with confirmed axonic<LINE>collapses", but that's as well as dead. The line between death and what the Task considers a solution can get blurry at times. However,<LINE>none of us still know what truly happened there. She can no longer be contacted.

Ivory was there to comfort me, however... Let's say, that I did and said some unforgivable things, before and after.<LINE>He's been in touch with me before too, asked about my city, the remaining volume of my void pocket, about my latest chats.<LINE>I cannot contact him anymore either. I am simply being ignored.

I don't blame him in the slightest. It's all my fault, of course. Now, out of our tightly knit "Sliverist"<LINE>group, as some unknowingly call us, only I and Suns remain. One died, one "went back into the hole he crawled out of", as I put it.<LINE>The others weren't from local group and we can't reach them now, probably due to collapsed communication towers.

Just a standard reminder, that we are in control of our own decisions - both good and bad.
