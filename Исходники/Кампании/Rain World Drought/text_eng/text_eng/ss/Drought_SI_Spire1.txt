Oh, I remember this. I can't say I don't regret some of my actions.<LINE>I'll read it to you.

"1627.104 - PUBLIC [FORCED]<LINE>Sliver Of Straw to Local Group + {NGI}

SOS: Everyone! I have a pleasant announcement~ 

FP: Ugh! What is it?

GW: Sliver, hello. You might have accidentally started a forced communication line with the entirety of our Local Group.

HF: Wind, she doesn't have the privileges, she can't force a group chat unless the solution is true and tried.

FP: Terrible feeling. I hope it's something serious.

NGI: Shut up for once and let her talk.

BSM: Please, speak up, what happened? For someone who started the whole conversation - you haven't written anything yet. I'm worried.

NSH: Haha, come on, she's shy, you know it. Come on girl, say it! We've got the stuff to help ya with if you need some!

SOS: Ah, I was preparing some checkpoints for the processes hehe I'm so sorry! Either way-- I have something very-VERY important to say!~

SOS: Triple affirmative!

SRS: ...No way.

NGI: Oh? Did, by any chance, those instructions bear fruit?

FP: What? Have you found a solution? Please, don't tell me it's a joke.

SOS: Not a joke, Pebbly~ Triple affirmative! I found it!

NSH: That's some serious stuff you spoke just now, Sliver, careful. Even I'm speechless!

SOS: [left the conversation]

FP: Sliver?

NGI: What was that? What just happened? Contact her, now, this instant. This isn't something to joke about.

FP: [left the conversation]

NSH: You're right Ivory, it sure does feels like a terrible joke. Heh, and I almost believed it!<LINE>To think that The Task could finally be solved. I owe you one, she got me here.

BSM: Oh, come on... Everyone, please calm down. There is clearly a good reason for that, we just need some more<LINE>time, wait a bit!

NGI: I never said such thing, NSH. We have an unprecedented situation at our hands, and you joke around.<LINE>This is why I very carefully choose who I even talk to.

HF: But... She forced a chat with an entire local group without senior privileges, this must mean that she has the solution.

NGI: There are 7 more eligible events that would allow one to force such a communication with others.

NSH: In any case Hal, we need to confirm the solution first before we jump to conclusions!<LINE>Where did Pebbles go?

BSM: I hope he isn't angry at her. He probably thinks it's a joke.

GW: Sliver mentioned checkpoints? I'm not sure I understand what those are, perhaps<LINE>my model is a bit too old, or I'm using a different terminology. Haven't spoken with her in a long time, somehow.<LINE>She's probably cleaning up, saving... Maybe. I cannot fathom the process...

SRS: I can't wait, the relief I feel right now is indescribable!

NSH: If her words are true, of course. I don't believe them. She disconnected so suddenly.

NGI: Give her time, everything was pretty well-documented.

SRS: I'm sure she's fine. And I trust her, I am her closest neighbor.

NSH: Your overseers can see what she's doing right now, right? Would be a funny joke, if that turned out a lie.<LINE>...Not so funny if she died from the solution itself."

We... couldn't contact her afterward. <LINE>Seven Red Suns confirmed later, that there was no rain from her can.

He didn't have to though. I have been personally monitoring her. I have sent my overseers out as far as possible. Any further and the connection would cut out.<LINE>I monitored her can for dozens of cycles non-stop, but it was as if she froze in time completely.<LINE>No rain, no signs of processing - nothing.

Back then, I left to start a communication with her.<LINE>I hoped to ask her why she left, but... No one knows what happened.

She was very important to me and Suns. The most creative and upbeat iterator, even more so than Suns.<LINE>But I feel like because of me something went wrong and thus I killed her.<LINE>We all miss her greatly, Suns the most, but with her gone I find myself stuck in desperation more often.
