0: In the initial tests, the damage from the bombs generated by the buff HighCaliber once reached as high as 200... Of course, this doesn't have much practical significance...
3: Later tests revealed that if the ClusterBomb buff was also equipped, excessively high explosion damage would produce a large number of small bombs and cause severe lag.
