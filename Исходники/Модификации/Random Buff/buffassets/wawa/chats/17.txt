0:Random Gain最开始是哈维主要负责框架，我主要负责界面设计这样
2:但是我并不擅长界面设计（让我写动效会死人的！），哈维也不算很擅长框架，总之就写的很烂...
1:于是干脆重头开始写更名为Random Buff，顺便交换了主要职责，然后写的顺畅多了（嗯）
1:有人好奇的话这里有Random Gain的下载链接（只兼容1.9.07b

0: Initially, Harvie was mainly responsible for the framework of Random Gain, while I was primarily in charge of the interface design.
2: But I'm not really good at interface design (making me write animations would be a nightmare!), and Harvey isn't particularly great at frameworks either, so overall, it was pretty poorly done...
1: So we decided to start over from scratch, renamed it to Random Buff, swapped our main responsibilities, and then things went much smoother (yeah).
1: If anyone's curious, here's the download link for Random Gain (only compatible with 1.9.07b).
