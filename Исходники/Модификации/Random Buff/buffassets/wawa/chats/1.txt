1: Did you know?
5: RandomBuff used to be called RandomGains.
3: But because the word "gains" seemed a bit odd, it was changed to its current name after the project was later restructured.

0: However, thanks to the efforts of CuteFatalis and other developers, the gameplay has evolved into its current form.
pkuyo: 1: What about me? The new mode was at least my idea.
harvie: 2: Ah, right, Pkuyo also helped a lot.
