SBCameraScroll Mod|
General:|
Camera Type|
Position (Default)|
This type tries to stay close to the player. A larger distance means a faster camera.\nThe smoothing factor determines how much of the distance is covered per frame.|
Vanilla|
Vanilla-style camera. You can center the camera by pressing the map button. Pressing the map button again will revert to vanilla camera positions.\nWhen the player is close to the edge of the screen the camera jumps a constant distance.|
Switch|
You can switch between the other two camera types by pressing the map button.\nThe keybinding can be configured using the mod 'Improved Input Config'.|
Full Screen Effects|
When disabled, full screen effects like fog, bloom and melt are removed.|
One Screen Rooms|
When disabled, the camera does not scroll in rooms with only one screen.|
Smoothing Factor (8)|
Determines how much of the distance is covered per frame. This is used when switching cameras as well to ensure a smooth transition.|
CLEAR CACHE|
The cache is not used anymore. Just clear it.|
///Position
Position|
Position Type Camera:|
Minimum Distance in X (2)|
The camera does not move when the player is closer than this.|
Minimum Distance in Y (2)|
The camera does not move when the player is closer than this.|
0 tiles|
35 tiles|
Camera Offset|
When enabled, the camera can move ahead but still stays within the minimum distance.|
Camera Offset Speed Multiplier (2)|
Determines how fast the camera pulls ahead. When set to 1.0 then the offset changes as fast as the player moves.|
///Vanilla
Vanilla|
Vanilla Type Camera:|
Distance from the Edge in X (9)|

Experimental|
Experimental:|
Camera Zoom (10)|
Works for the most part but makes some shaders glitch out more. Not used when the SplitScreen Co-op mod is active.|
Dynamic Zoom|
When enabled, the camera zoom is adjusted dynamically per room. This removes any black borders when using custom resolutions.\nEnables scrolling in one-screen rooms. Disabled when SplitScreen Coop is used.|
Custom Resolution:|
Requires the format \"WIDTHxHEIGHT\". Needs to be at least 960x540.\nFirst, you need to select \"Custom\" in the Resolution combo box.|
Resolution:|
Overrides the current resolution. Can be used to zoom out with less\npixelation issues. Might reduce black borders on larger monitors.|
Default|
Resets the screen resolution.|
Sets the screen resolution to " + resolution + " pixels.|
Custom|
Uses the resolution from the text box `Custom Resolution:`.|
