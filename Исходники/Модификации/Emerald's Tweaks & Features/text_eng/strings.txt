Gives all slugcats increased breath while underwater.
Disables auto-grabbing of batflys. For those who don't need the game to do it for them.
Allows all slugcats to equip a backspear, even when not playing expedition mode.
Allows all slugcats to passively gain reputation by simply existing, and allows Artificer to befriend Scavengers. Go make some friends!
Buffs Gourmand's climbing speed, and allows him to throw more spears before getting winded.
Allows Saint to throw spears. Now you can finally open those popcorn plants!
Makes it so Saint no longer gets one shot by everything.
Makes Spearmaster as thick as the other slugcats.
Gives you fluffier fur, allowing you to stay out in the cold without freezing. Lasts until the blizzard starts.
Makes spears, and rocks thrown by you deal increased damage. Mauling also deals quite a bit more damage as well.
Coats your body in a powerful antacid, allowing you to touch spicy water multiple times without dying.
Allows you to start with the Neuron Glow effect.
Allows you to start with the Mark of Communication. [May Have Weird Sideeffects!]
Allows you to encounter echos without activating them first. (If you have enough karma) [BREAKS SAINT & ARTIFICER CAMPAIGNS!]
Allows Saint and Artificer to start the game with 5 karma levels already unlocked.
Allows a variety of special spear types to spawn naturally in all campaigns.
Adds a new keybind that allows you to do a small backflip. (Works on poles!
[Spoilers] Allows you to yeet firebug eggs with the same strength as throwing a spear.
[Spoilers] Makes poison tipped spears never run out.
Allows you to use a passage as many times as you want. Picks art at random from currently acquired passages.
Allows Hunter and Saint to use passages. Finally!
Forces the cycle timer to always show, regardless of character, or region.
Prevents 'most' leeches from grabbing on to you. Other creatures are not affected by this effect.
Gives garbage worms a newfound respect for slugcats, so they no longer steal your spears. They still steal from scavs though, because they deserve it.
Makes wormgrass unable to touch you. Now you can finally enjoy Farm Arrays without using the deer!
Tired of dying to the rot covered walls that can't even move? Well with this new lubricative solution, you can glide off them with ease!
\"Stowaway isn't real! Stowaway can't hurt you!\" Makes stowaways much more likely to be awake, so that they can be encountered more often.
Tired of barnacles getting in the way? Well chuck a few stones at them and watch their pesky shells shatter!
Makes slugpups more brave, so they won't grasp onto you and hinder your movement unless you grab them.
Prevents the guide overseer from spawning, allowing you to explore without it's guidance. (Reduced chance of a scav 'accidentally' killing you)
Adds various random wakeup events. Face the dangers of the night, or enjoy frolicking in the snow. It's up to you! [Neuron Light Recommended]
Adds rare creature variants into the game to spice up your exploration. Variants come in wacky colors, like rainbow, monochrome, and more!
