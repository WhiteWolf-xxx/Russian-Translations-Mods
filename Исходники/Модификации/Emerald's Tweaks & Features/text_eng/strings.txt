emeralds_features-description|An expansive collection of tweaks, features, fixes and assists to help fine tune and improve your Rain World experience.\n\nSince the start of Downpour's release, I have compiled a mod\nincluding all the tweaks, fixes, and features I've made\nto make the game more enjoyable (and bearable).\n\nThere are quite a few tweaks here so there's bound to be something\nfor everyone. And in addition, there are also some cool features\nto enjoy like rare creatures and more.\n\nThis would never have come out if my friends Arden\nand Lucky didn't encourage me to release it, so\nthank you guys for the support <3
