This one is rather bizzare. It is written in a very old discrete format, one of those which proved impractical long before a first iterator was built, 
but the contents are not that ancient, as far as I can decode. Wait, you don't even know what "discrete" means, do you?

Well, let me give you an example. Imagine eating a large, juicy fruit. Or just remember the last time you did that. When you think of an action like this one, you don't think separately about how your teeth move,
the angle at which they cut the fruit's skin, how many of your taste receptors are activated at any time - you just process this experience as a whole. This is called "continuous perception".

"Discrete perception" is the opposite side and, for all I know, it is not a thing that exists.
