Quite weathered out, but contents are still intelligible.

Inside, there's a picture of a plant, gently held by three different appendages. 
First looks like a standard issue hand of one of our "parents", another is a mechanical protrusion, hydraulics driven. 
The third... It's organic, but I don't think I recognize its form.

Although, it does remind me of one thing. It's a little bit like a scavenger hand... A hand of a scavenger that uses hammers and welding kits more often than spears, perhaps? What a silly thought.
