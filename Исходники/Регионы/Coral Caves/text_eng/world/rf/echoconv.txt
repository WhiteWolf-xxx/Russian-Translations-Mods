(X-Saint)What does it mean to fade away?

(X-Saint)To erase oneself is a simple task, but there is more to oneself than just a vessel.

(X-Saint)The marks left behind, the scars we create, take longer to fade.

(X-Saint)An attempt was made at true termination.<LINE>The goal was virtuous, but our perception of nature was flawed.

(X-Saint)How foolish we were, to think we could escape.<LINE>Our monuments were too grand to be reverted.

(X-Saint)The scars on this world shall grow evermore.



(Saint)I sense a connection between us.<LINE>Two beings trapped in a cycle of their own undoing.

(Saint)The path I traveled was a righteous one.<LINE>I saw that the world was scarred by our actions and sought to undo them.

(Saint)Yet, to change the world by your own image is an act of hubris.<LINE>The salvation I brought was yet another reckless act.

(Saint)In the eternities I’ve spent trapped down here, I've come to realize that the world moves on in spite of our actions.<LINE>I’ve watched the surface get overtaken by ice, and seen new life emerge from the ruins.

(Saint)From these deepest scars, emerged something beautiful.
