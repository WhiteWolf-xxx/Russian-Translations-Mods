It’s the genome for a purposed organism.<LINE>To be honest, I’m not sure what the purpose of this one is.

According to these notes, it is a colony of microscopic organisms capable of consuming a variety of<LINE>metal and artificial materials, creating a mineral-based skeleton as a byproduct of the reaction.

My initial guess was that this was a waste disposal unit, but there doesn’t seem to be any mechanical devices put in place to control the organism’s rate of consumption or reproduction.<LINE>It doesn’t even have the standard containment box that most purposed organisms are fitted with!

I’m most certain that this genome breaks many of the regulations of purposed organism design.<LINE>If this organism was ever released, it could lead to uncontrolled structural decay!

I hope that these plans were not developed further.
