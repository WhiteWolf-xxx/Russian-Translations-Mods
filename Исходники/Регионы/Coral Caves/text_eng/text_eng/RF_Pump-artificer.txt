This is the genome for a purposed organism, a microbial colony by the looks of it.

Strange... the ID of this organism isn’t registered anywhere in my catalogues.<LINE>The genome itself is short, relatively speaking, so I can quickly review it.

Let's see... the cellular anatomy is quite standard for this type organism.

Many of the lines here relate to the organism's respiration.<LINE>There was clearly some effort taken to improve its efficiency.

Yet the structure of the colony itself can only be described as rudimentary, almost rock-like in its simplicity.<LINE>A far cry from the complex, self-repairing lattices that were typical of the time this was drafted.

And now that I look at this as a whole, there doesn't seem to be any kind of constraints whatsoever.<LINE>No division inhibitors, barely any dietary restrictions, and the organism isn't even fitted with a standard containment box!

The inadequacy of whoever wrote this genome is genuinely hazardous...

Regardless, thank you for bringing me this, even if there's not<LINE>much of a purpose to maintaining the organism catalogue these days.
