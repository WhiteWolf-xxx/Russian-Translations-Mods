Hello little creature.<LINE>What brings you to these gardens?

When I still had my senses, I would lie in this very place, pondering what I was.

Do you know what you are? Does your existence trouble you as much as mine troubled me?

(Yellow)For you are balanced in mind and soft of heart. 

(Yellow)Then why do you linger? Are you searching for another?<LINE>I'm afraid what you seek cannot be found here.

(Yellow)So look elsewhere, lest you lose yourself amongst the swaying fronds.

(White)For you are alone, lost in this strange land.<LINE>Looking for answers but finding only more questions.

(White)However, I envy your being, for discovery is a gift. What wonders lie beyond our horizons?

(White)Yet no matter how far you travel beyond these emerald hills, the cycle will continue.

(Red)For you are imbalanced, with discordance in your heart.<LINE>It must be difficult, to live in a world which despises those that do not belong.

(Red)Yet in you I see a purpose.<LINE>How far have you traveled to reach these emerald hills?

(Red)Your journey is coming to an end. I hope you arrive at the destination you seek.
