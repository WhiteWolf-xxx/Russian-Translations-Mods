Itâ€™s a log of operations of Probationary District 4B.

Do you know what that is? Probably not.

Being a newer model, Five Pebbles had a number of experimental technologies embedded onto his can, one of these being Probationary District 4B.

4B is an entire district dedicated to folding space with the aim of achieving teleportation.

Of course, bending the space-time continuum is an exceedingly hard thing to do,<LINE>so despite the large amount of machinery dedicated to the project only small objects can be moved through its folds.

Perhaps with time the process could be made more efficient but my creators cannot work on it anymore.
