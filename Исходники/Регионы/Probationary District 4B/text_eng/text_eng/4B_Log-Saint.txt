Itâ€™s a log of operations of Probationary District 4B.

Do you know what that is? Probably not.

Being a newer model, Five Pebbles had a number of experimental technologies embedded onto his can, one of these being Probationary District 4B.

4B is an entire district dedicated to folding space with the aim of achieving teleportation.

Of course, bending the space-time continuum is an exceedingly hard thing to do,<LINE>so despite the large amount of machinery dedicated to the project only small objects can be moved through its folds.

What's strange is that the processes shown here are dated fairly recently.

It's hard to believe the facility still works given all the punishment Five Pebble's facility has taken but the data here is pretty clear.

Hopefully this means Five Pebbles is still around.
