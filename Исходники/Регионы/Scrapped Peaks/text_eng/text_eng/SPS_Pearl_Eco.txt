Oh my!

A very interesting discovery you have made, little one!

This pearl appears to contain an old data log,<LINE>that describes a very ecologically dense area with an unnaturally high presence of flora.

It must have been quite a sight to see.<LINE>Though I doubt there is still much there to see, after the rain has<LINE>flattened the lands and washed out over 84% of plant and animal species.

Our creators have been able to provide us with a massive array of different ancient<LINE>samples of flora and fauna, that were used to create the purposed creatures.

There was once a point in time where I had access to many of these data samples.<LINE>Some of them contained simple data portfolios.<LINE>And some others contained detailed requests for purposed creatures,<LINE>that were desired by our creators.

One day I hope to grow old enough that the natural world might seize the walls of my chamber,<LINE>and I can see the beauty that has been described to us so many times.
