Oh Dear...

It seems you have discovered something... quite unsettling.

The information inside has mostly decayed.<LINE>But from what I can gather, it seems to describe a modified structure,<LINE>that sits on the very edge of Five Pebbles' foundation.

There are several mentions of controlled system floods, targeting a parasitic biomass.<LINE>This biomass was intended to be ejected out through this new system.

There was more information, but it has been corrupted...

This pearl was likely never meant to be read by others,<LINE>but I find it interesting that he has managed to modify a part of his complex<LINE>in such an extreme fashion without orders from our creators. 

It saddens me to know how much of himself he has lost.

If you ever see Five Pebbles again, please send him my regards.
