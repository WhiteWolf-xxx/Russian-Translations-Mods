This shall be my final record here.

I laid my life's work out to the world. A solution to the problem of which their constructs toiled away, an alternate freedom, without the consequences they so willingly ignoreâ€¦

And they SHUNNED it! Declared it treason to the virtues we all live by.

This was a possibility I had foreseen, and I had made the necessary measures to hide my association to my discovery.<LINE>Still, I fear it is only a matter of time before the veil is uncovered, and my work is burned to the ground.

It was my intention to, in my final days, immerse myself in my creation, surrounded by the creatures I had lovingly raised and tended to.<LINE>But now, I shall give the conformists what they want, and submit to the departure I for so long avoided.

I can only hope that whoever finds this note will continue this path that I paved for the world.
