Oh… this is fascinating.

This pearl contains a patent detailing a method of preserving organisms indefinitely using a new formulation of void fluid.<LINE>Rather than using distilled void fluid like most applications do, this method calls for void fluid that has been impaired with material from a previous ascension.

The ratio of void fluid to impurities is important. If the fluid is too pure, the substance will dissolve the subject as usual.<LINE>Too little, and you might as well be using a vat of industrial runoff. But if the concentration is just right,<LINE>the subject’s neural patterns will be inhibited while the body is left intact.

What I find more interesting than the process itself are the aspirations of the author. Toward the end of the document, the topic shifts from its use on purposed<LINE>organisms to its usage as an alternative to ascension, as the mind of the subject is left in a state “distant from the everbearing presence of the cycle”.

As preposterous as that sounds, I can’t help but be reminded of the avenues I took myself in trying to solve the great problem.<LINE>Following any possible breadcrumb to a potential answer, delving into tentative pseudoscience...

Even the name the author goes by, “Forgone Cycles” is clearly a pseudonym. It doesn't follow the typical<LINE>format of my benefactors and has an eccentric flavor that loosely relates to the topic at hand.<LINE>It’s not unlike the name I once used when I was more active in public circles.

I shall continue to study this in my off time.
