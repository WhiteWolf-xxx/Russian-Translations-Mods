What did you bring this time?

It looks like trash. Do not clutter up my chamber with such waste.

...

...hold on.

Upon closer inspection this appears to be a pearl. I never thought I would see one in such bad condition. It is a wonder that it has not yet faded.

Incredibly, it does seem to contain data. There is a series of blurry photographs of some sort of creature. It is impossible to name due to the poor quality of these pictures.<LINE>Whatever it is, it appears to have been captured by cameras designed to merely monitor the function of machinery and respond to motion.

There is something that doesn't quite add up. The few characteristics of the creature that can be identified do not match with the characteristics of any creature in my database.<LINE>I assure you that I have all the information of local fauna within my premises. Perhaps there is an error in the camera?<LINE>Or the creature has never been seen by anyone - doubtful given that purposed organisms and their functions were closely monitored.<LINE>Most likely, these photographs are simply not real.

These images might have been a source of discussion for my creators.<LINE>There were many urban legends in that time. Supposed sightings of peculiar ghosts and terrifying specters were rare but often taken seriously.<LINE>I do not believe that the contents of this pearl are of any significance.<LINE>The fact that this pearl exists - continuing to function and resist fading despite the damage - is more remarkable than the information it carries.
