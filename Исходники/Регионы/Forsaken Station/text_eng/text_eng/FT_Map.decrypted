It seems this is a map of the Paramount Terminal in the final stages of construction.

Contains all the connections made at the time to places like the Atmopleura, <LINE> the Northern Windstep Spires, the Factory Complex, my neighbor Five Pebbles, and myself.

There are also paths going beyond my facility grounds far beyond into the expanse of heaped ruins.

I have my doubts with those paths still holding up... Considering how unstable the terrain can be out there.
