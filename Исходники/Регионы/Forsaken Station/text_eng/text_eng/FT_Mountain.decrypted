0-FT_Mountain
It's a record from one of the northbound rail lines.

This line was used to transport void fluid extracted from deep within a mountain range far from here.<LINE> It was meant to be an auxiliary source... a back up of sorts to the previously established excavation sites.

It seems as if the path was abruptly closed off via use of explosives. Access beyond the retaining <LINE> wall sealed off. No reason is given for the closure of the line - operations seemed to be going as planned.

This is abnormal... it seems the logs have been intentionally tampered with.

I can surmise that whatever lies beyond the wall, in that mountainous zone <LINE> was something deeply disturbing to my creators.
