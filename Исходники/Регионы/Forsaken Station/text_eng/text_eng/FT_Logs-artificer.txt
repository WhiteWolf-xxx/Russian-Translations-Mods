This appears to be a type of pearl that collects and stores data in real time, an earlier form of the pearls I use in this chamber. 

The one you brought contains several logs noting machinery errors in surrounding networks, as well as closed off train lines.<LINE>The information is largely redundant - I have to wonder why my creators didn't shut down this useless system before departing.

Though, it seems this pearl does contain something worth mentioning. An interaction between two stations;<LINE>one located in my territories known as the Paramount Nucleus Terminal, and another much further to the northeast, Bound High-Point Terminal.

I am not going to go into the details of their conversation, as I do not see it as relevant. A summary will do.

Over the course of several cycles, some issues with the rails between the two stations arose, likely due to unstable terrain.<LINE>This was noted to have affected trade during the reconstruction period.

Once this issue was fixed, the trade routes resumed, where goods such as Rich Nectar, Micro-engineered waters and even various substrates were transferred as normal.<LINE>A good part of these trades helped speed up the creation of Looks to the Moon, and eventually myself.

Judging by the state of this pearl, the station must be slowly decaying, like everything my creators once felt pride in.<LINE>All the described trade routes are likely destroyed - I would be surprised if any of them are still in good condition.
