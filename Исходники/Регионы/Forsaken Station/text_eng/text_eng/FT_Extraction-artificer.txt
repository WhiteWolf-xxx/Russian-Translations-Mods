What do you have here? Another pearl?

Interesting, it's been a long time since I've seen this type of pearl composition.<LINE>Normally this structure allows storing large amounts of information, even more than what I use in my chamber.<LINE>It was common for such pearls to be used for studies that require large data compilations.

From what I can see, this pearl was used for a study related to a large body of subterranean water, with a type of creature that I have in my database.<LINE>This specimen has a special genotype which helps eliminate bacteria and dirt in a liquid body at surprising speeds - purifying it, in simpler terms.

This type of water was used for a range of applications, such as vacuum fluid extraction, although I consider that this type of water can be better used for cooling my superstructure.

If this specimen had been introduced into larger nearby bodies of water, I likely wouldn't need to use so much water for my own purposes.<LINE>I would carry out an operation to release these creatures into the entire aqueduct system, but something tells me they weren't released for some reason.<LINE>Perhaps on a large scale, they would be more of a long term problem than a temporary solution.

What I don't understand is why they stopped this research after the void fluid revolution, and the construction of the train lines to other territories.<LINE>A pity they didn't take advantage of its potential.

I'd rather you leave this pearl here with me - it will be safer than wherever you found it. Perhaps I will research this specimen further in the future.
