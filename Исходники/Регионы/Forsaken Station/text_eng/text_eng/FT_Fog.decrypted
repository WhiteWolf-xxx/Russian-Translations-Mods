0-FT_Fog
It's a report of a broken machine informing that there is a missing arm.<LINE> Looks to have been ripped off violently.

This incident occurred during a very thick fog cover that had been accumulating from the construction <LINE> of the weather control structure close by.

I'm unaware if the facility is still functional, but seems like it exhaust a lot of water vapor, <LINE> altering the weather locally in the area.

There is something else in this report.

A sighting of an unidentified organism hiding in the fog, supposedly "stalking" the team sent to <LINE> repair the broken arm. It's still unknown what exactly they encountered during the repairs. 

Would you know about that?
