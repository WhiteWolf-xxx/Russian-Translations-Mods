It's a recording of a council debate, though I don't recognize the participants. My guess would be that this is a council of Looks to the Moon's population, from the ceremonial dressings.

From what I can see, it's decoded in a way that only a few know, denoting the discussion's sensitivity. I wonder if it was directed at my creators, or someone else outside the local group.

...

I'll limit myself to mentioning the most interesting parts of the discussion.

It seems that a venture to the northwest mountainous zone of the local territory, outside the retaining wall, is the focus of the debate.<LINE>Something that disturbs them, brings them fear... quite uncharacteristic for such an occasion.

The ceremony concludes with a ritual of silencing. They denied whatever they had seen there was real.

Our creators hate having their beliefs and ways of understanding the world challenged, even causing our kind to seek solutions based on what they believe.<LINE>This changed when they left. While some continued this approach, others began to look for new ways to solve the big problem from another dogma. 

For my part, I believe that this whole matter is somewhat irrelevant,<LINE>as they removed the only direct path to the mountain and my overseers cannot access it.
