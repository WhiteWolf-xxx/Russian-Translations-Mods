What are you doing here little creature?

Are you lost in this place long long forgotten? Where nature has steadily taken back its territory?

I've yet to forget how loud it was and how important I was!

Ensuring all operations were as fluid as water!

Machines creaking through their now pointless tasks

All that's left for me is to enjoy this endless landscape, observing the remnants of metal decaying with the passage of time.
