An unexpected visit, but a welcome one.

You have found a place that is lost to time itself, where the grasping of the earth has taken root.

I still recall what was once heard here... the chatters, the logs. I was an important part of something, one component of a whole.

A whole that is now unrecognizable, fading flickers strewn across dying soil.

Our monuments, holding such pride in their creation, keel to the crumbling earth.

Now all that endures are the gentle rays of sundown, before all falls to silence under the endless storms.
