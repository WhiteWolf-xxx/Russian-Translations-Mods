Bro: This is the only remaining room from Old Old Swamplands.<LINE>Everything else was completely remade.

Bro: Old Old Swamplands (the purple one that was released separately) fit into the pack<LINE>slightly differently than the current version does.

Bro: If you watch FishSwallower's old Subway Lines video, you can see where it connected to in Old Old Swamplands.<LINE>And the Oil Station connection would've been in the bottom right, where it connected to Shoreline in the 1.5 version.

Bro: I'm really glad Swamplands got remade, because the earliest version was Not Fun.

Bro: This version is kinda funky, and the trees are a little uncanny,<LINE>but overall it's much less awful than Old Old Swamplands.

Bro: New New Horizons contains a spiritual successor to Swamplands, which is<LINE>one of my favorite regions of the pack so far. I hope people can look forward to NNH~
