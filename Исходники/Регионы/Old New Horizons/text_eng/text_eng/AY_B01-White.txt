Bro: This originally led to a 'Memory Crypts' subregion. You can still see how it connected in<LINE>the FishSwallower videos titled "a place that i'm proud of" and "rain world - Creative title #536"

Bro: And honestly seeing those rooms was the first time I started taking ONH seriously, because they were so cool.

Bro: It was removed from ONH because FishSwallower was still planning on using it in NNH.

Bro: Although… I don't know where she would've used those rooms? They didn't fit into any of her plans,<LINE>and they can't really be moved to a different area, as they're such a specific structure.

Bro: But they did provide a route that skips Abyss completely, so I'm glad they're pulled.<LINE>Abyss isn't particularly fun, but it is a grand setpiece that I don't want to be skipped.

Bro: ONH alt definitely wasn't happy about its removal though, after revamping The Leg just to connect there…
