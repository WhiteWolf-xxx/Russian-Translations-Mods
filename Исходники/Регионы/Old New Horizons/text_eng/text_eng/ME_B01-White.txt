Bro: A small update to the mod in December 2022 added a few new shelters, like this one.

Bro: I still remember Laura being absolutely furious that it was so easy to miss the shelters coming out of Incinerator.

Bro: Hopefully 2 out of 3 paths is good enough for her.

Bro: Originally, instead of a shelter, this lead to 'the highway rooms.'<LINE>You can see these rooms in Balagaga's video 'slugcat ATONES'<LINE>It was an incredibly long dead-end that'd waste an entire cycle.

Bro: I feel a bit weird about replacing those rooms entirely with this shelter.<LINE>Design-wise, it's definitely better, but also it's the only thing that's been removed.

Bro: (and I think Solar is still upset with me for removing them)
