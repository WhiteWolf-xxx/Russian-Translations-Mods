Bro: Ok so you may be wondering: that other dev commentary<LINE>said this area was removed, why's it back?

Bro: Well, Arti needs a way across Abyss, of course!

Bro: Fish wanted it removed to keep it in NNH,<LINE>but she's gone now so I can do whatever I want.

Bro: And as I mentioned before, I don't know how it'd fit in NNH so it's here now.

Bro: I did have to do surgery on lower Abyss though, to make it long enough.
