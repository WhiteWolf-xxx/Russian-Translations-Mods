Bro: Ugh, Oil Station is such a rough region, definitely my least favorite.

Bro: Gotta cut it some slack though, it's the oldest ONH region.<LINE>Speaking of, I'll take this opportunity to go over the development order of each region.

Bro: First was Swamplands, then Oil Station, with Abyss, and Subway Lines starting development partway through OS. 

Bro: Then Swamplands was completely remade, and Suburbs started development.

Bro: Next was Central Factory, then Farlands, and finally Railway.

Bro: ONH began development in early 2020, and the latest room made was done in late 2021.

Bro: Making 8 regions and over 1,000 screens in less than 2 years is insane,<LINE>and I'll always respect the shear quantity of content FishSwallower has made.
