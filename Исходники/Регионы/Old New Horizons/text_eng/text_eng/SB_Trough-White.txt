Bro: I've pretty much always wanted Farlands to connect to the Fissure, but since we knew<LINE>that entrance would be difficult to reach and to find, I stuck another gate down here.

Bro: This gate was connected to the Limestone Caves, hence the water in the previous room.

Bro: But when I showed the finished connection to Solar, he told me that<LINE>Limestone Caves needed to stay as a dead-end, and that we couldn't use the gate.

Bro: But I didn't want to throw out the rooms I'd made, and the Fissure connection<LINE>was still too obscure and difficult, so that's where I got the idea for the Grapple Challenge.

Bro: You can still see some of the gate tiles here, all bent out of shape.
