Bro: With my coding abilities, I could totally find a diegetic way to do this tutorial.

Bro: Whether it be done with a text popup, or maybe an overseer showing the controls.

Bro: But half the fun of exploring scrapped regions is seeing all the quirky things it did. Like this!

Bro: And so part of the way I treat ONH is to try to preserve these rougher, less serious bits,<LINE>while smoothing out anything that doesn't directly contribute to that feeling.

Bro: Even just 30 minutes level editing every room would improve the pack so much,<LINE>but I resist the temptation in order to preserve the feeling of something rougher, more personal.

Bro: (I can't wait to start working on NNH, where that doesn't matter anymore)
