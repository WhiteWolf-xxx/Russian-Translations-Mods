Bro: This entrance used to connect to Subterranean.<LINE>You can find the gate still in the files.

Bro: This area was made in kind of a transitionary period when New Horizons was going from some<LINE>regions that added some shortcuts through vanilla to a more isolated adventure, with its own campaign.

Bro: This was supposed to lead to a gate to Outskirts

Bro: Yeah... Outskirts.

Bro: It might be weird, but if you remember, Outskirts had been redone to look like Farlands.<LINE> I'm not sure how exactly it makes sense geographically, but FishSwallower says it was done for technical reasons.

Bro: But in the end these connections were never made, only planned.

Bro: Honestly it's a good thing, as Pump Station is horrible to play.
