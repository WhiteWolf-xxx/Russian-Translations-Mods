Bro: This room was going to lead to a gate to The Wall.

Bro: It actually replaced the Chimney Canopy gate,<LINE>with Chimney leading to Swamplands instead.

Bro: I briefly considered making a gate connection here too, but I didn't<LINE>want to make another connection on top of the two I was already doing.

Bro: And now I'm glad I didn't add this gate. There's no good<LINE>place to connect in The Wall, and it'd be too easy to find.

Bro: So this room is stuck in limbo, leading to a path that will never exist.<LINE>It's okay, it'll Soon lead elsewhere...
