Bro: Suburbs is so funky and un-Rain Worldy. Neither me nor Solar<LINE>liked it very much and I almost wanted to cut it out of the pack at first.

Bro: But after redoing all the creatures in the region, suddenly it became one of the most fun regions.

Bro: Creature placement is the core of Rain World! Regions should be planned around exploring<LINE>different combinations of creatures, and rooms should be designed for the creatures that pass through.

Bro: Most of ONH is designed more for the player than anything else, so most areas are heavily restricted in which creatures would be fair.

Bro: With Suburbs spawns, I got a little wild. I wanted it to be a massive lizard brawl region, with nearly every single type of lizard present.<LINE>Normally that approach is bad design and feels spammy, but for Suburbs I gave each lizard type a distinct area that overlaps with other lizard areas.

Bro: Greens in the bottom right; yellows in the bottom middle; blues in the true middle; pinks in the halls;<LINE>whites towards the left & top; salamander in the sewers; cyans wherever they want to go.

Bro: With MSC slugs I got a little creative with the spawns, but the principle stays the same.

Bro: And I think it works very well! The lizards feel very diverse, but there are rarely too many types of lizards in one area.
