Bro: Originally, when passing through this room an explosion sound would play.<LINE>(You can still find that sound in the files!)

Bro: This was meant to indicate the collapse of Moon.

Bro: Yeah... the mod was very different back then. Pretty much functioning<LINE>as a brand-new slugcat, who just happened to be a copy of Survivor.

Bro: When eventually arriving back at the vanilla regions, the player would find that many things have changed.<LINE>If only there were a way to play that version now... *cough cough*
