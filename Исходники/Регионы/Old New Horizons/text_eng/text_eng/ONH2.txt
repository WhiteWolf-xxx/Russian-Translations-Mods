It's a documentation of an extensive geological analysis, in search of oil reserves.<LINE>The results show findings of a massive reserve located not too far from here.

Due to the non-renewability of oil, it was rarely used.<LINE>More sustainable sources of energy - such as Nuclear Fusion or Void Fluid - were virtually always superior.

But it seems this reserve is intended to be used not as an energy source,<LINE>but as a dilutant to Void Fluid, to prevent it from dissolving the pipes.

It's a very dangerous and temporary solution - once the reserve runs dry,<LINE>the best scenario is that anything relying on it will become disfunctional.

But the worst case...
