Bro: Ooh, where could this spooky and unnecessarily deep room lead?~

Bro: Unfortunately, I can't really say. It was gonna be a super-secret end-game region,<LINE>but that region is still gonna be in NNH so the super-secret will have to stay so.

Bro: (thOUGH FishSwallower didn't tell me exactly what she had in mind, so really I'm making my own thing up anyways)

Bro: We wanted to put a pearl down here so it's not a complete waste of time,<LINE>but FishSwallower didn't write the Lore. So it'll remain a spooky and unnecessarily deep room.
