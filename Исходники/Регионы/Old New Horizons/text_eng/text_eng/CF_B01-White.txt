Bro: According to FishSwallower, this area would lead to an expansive cave system.

Bro: The player would wander through, having no idea where they are or where they're going,<LINE>with the caves stretching on seemingly forever.

Bro: Then they'd find a gate and they'd pop back up into Shoreline, or some other place equally as random.

Bro: It feels like a Cool Idea, but in practice I reckon it'd be more annoying than anything.<LINE>Missing one jump forcing you to do 10 minutes of empty gameplay to get thrown somewhere else entirely...

Bro: Yeah, I'm kinda glad FishSwallower never finished this section. I've got Other Plans for it, though...
