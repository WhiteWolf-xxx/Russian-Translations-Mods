It is a wretched nostalgia that holds us now.I was among thousands of architects.<LINE>We built elaborate stores of machinery and called them temples. â€¦spoke in whispered words on transformation,<LINE>and brewed necrotic drinks within great cisterns.And one day it will spill out like shattered notes onto a distant score.We recorded these songs and etched them into metal.<LINE>The last testimonies of our civilization.I wonder...can you hear me?<LINE>My final words...are they are monument to nothing?
