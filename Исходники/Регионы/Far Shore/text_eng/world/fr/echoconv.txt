(X-Saint)Greetings, fellow traveller!(X-Saint)Take a moment and admire these vistas of uncharted lands, isn't it a sight to behold?(X-Saint)How could one have the will to explore its inner self when the call of the wild expanses is so thunderous?(X-Saint)I pity monks and scholars, deaf to the great song of the outdoors. I followed them, but at what end?(X-Saint)This was a late lesson, but I learned my place was here, forever lingering for adventure.(X-Saint)My existence will always be one of a fierce explorer, in search for a splinter of their glorious ambition.(X-Saint)I hope you'll find the peace I relinquished, little creature.(Saint)Finally we meet.(Saint)I am honored by your presence, little one.(Saint)Tell me, what do you seek here?(Saint)For there is nothing left to see. I was wrong.(Saint)The unknown is elsewhere, beyond the wretched remains of this world.(Saint)You come from a place so vast. I envy you.(Saint)Go now, for there is nothing left to say.
