Oh no...
You must have found this near Pebbles' retaining wall I presume?
This is not your typical pearl.
These are used to mark the borders of a scavenger tribe's territory.
Since the shallow waters in front of the wall are the only access to the mainland, the scavengers of my island attempted to expand that way.
Unfortunately Pebbles' grounds are occupied by another, hostile tribe.
This led to a gruesome war between the two.
It finished in a stalemate, with the retaining wall becoming a demarcation zone.
You should put it back where you found this. I don't want to see another conflict tearing through my scavenger population.
