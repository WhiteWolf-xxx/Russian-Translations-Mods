Ah, you seem to have found some instructions going over the process of making bells.<LINE>This was a ritual performed by monks, often assigned to those seeking initiation into certain spiritual organisations.

Bells symbolise rebirth: long ago - before the void revolution, even - it was tradition to ring out<LINE>a celebratory chime to welcome the beginning of a new cycle, and a knell to see off the end. 

Of course, as the cycles go on, throughout each life that comes and goes, the two begin<LINE>to blend together into a chaotic din - hence the association came to be.

Given what they represent, many special conditions that reflect the vices all beings possess must be met during the process of crafting them.

Firstly, one must fast throughout the duration of their assembly. Strictly no food is<LINE>to be eaten until the bell has been hung up and rung for the first time.

One must also keep their mind trained on the task at all times - to let your thoughts wander is to exhibit desireful behavior.

The bell must be assembled in complete solitude, and involves manipulating searing hot metals<LINE>with bare hands, remaining calm throughout. If it didn't shackle them to this existence, I'm sure many monks<LINE>would have taken pride in the callouses they developed after making their first bells.

As for why they chose to adorn their temples with a symbol of the very thing they'd dedicated their lives to escaping?

...I suppose in a way they could serve as a comforting reminder that eventually, one of those tolls would be the last they'd ever hear.
