You found an instruction set for making bells for temples.
The way you make them is by collecting scrap, melting it down,<LINE>purifying it and casting it into one of several molds.
Now while the process itself is relatively simple for those who already know metalworking<LINE>their traditions dictated that this be done in complete solitude and without eating food or water for the entire duration.
If you think this made the process unecesarily tedious you would be correct, though I suppose it is the ritual that elevates temple bells over common bells.
