Another cycle draws to a close, and yet here I remain...

Whilst others take shelter, I stand here: looking up at the vast emptiness above, much like the one below.

You've felt it too, haven't you?

That intoxicating pull at your very being, beckoning you deeper, yet deeper still.

Ironic, that in the end we were never any different  from the very bugs we looked down upon.

...

Go, little friend.

You do not need to wait for the rain with me.
