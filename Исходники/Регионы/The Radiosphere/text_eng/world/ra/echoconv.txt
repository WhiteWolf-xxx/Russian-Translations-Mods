How intriguing your presence is, little stargazer.

Are you curious too? Oddly, you resemble your ancestors yet differ.

Like this place, unchanged.

We constructed it to endure, but we faltered ourselves.

Primitive, brutal, unforgiving.

This place was not made to honor time, but to oppose it.

A monument to our dedication, a monument to our ignorance of the world.

We used it to speak, not to listen.

Now we sit in the unknowing dark.
