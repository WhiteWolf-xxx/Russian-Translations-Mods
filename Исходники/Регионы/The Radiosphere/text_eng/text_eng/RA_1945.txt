Where did you find this, little creature?

This is a very old transcript manifest, but the last update was very recent.

It's from a place quite a long distance from here.

Did you find that in the old direct transmission installation?

It was an early attempt by my creators to link multiple different iterators with a high-bandwidth connection.

The sheer amount of information we would have produced and exchanged would have been massive.

It was barely used because of how much energy and water it consumed, with no significant benefit.

But its design isn't complex—just recording and archiving machines, a lot of power circuitry, and antennas.

It was also encapsulated in self-sealing concrete to prevent interference, which definitely helps it stay functional.

But that was a long time ago, before the mast concept was introduced, which allowed for slower speeds but a much greater reach.

I'm not surprised it still remains functional to some extent.

I might be able to regain a connection with that area of the facility.

Although, right now in my current state, I wouldn't be able to transmit much; the old technology was quite inefficient, and I wouldn't have enough energy to do so. Nor am I sure the power lines aren't eroded.

But I can still use it to listen; that requires very little.

...

Admittedly, I don't think on the frequencies the array can detect well, there will be anything useful, unfortunately.

But the sounds of the sky will perhaps be relaxing to listen to.

Thank you, little creature. This is a very interesting find of yours.
