This one is part of a stock list for a shipment of various goods, from a western growing plant.<LINE>It's written to be read by a sorting automaton, so most of it won't make much sense to you. 

This pearl specifically documents an order of various ferns and palm leaves, which were to be ground up and distributed<LINE>amongst the "Benevolent Communion of Ceaseless Virtuosity and Splendor" for some kind of spiritual practice. 

Underneath that, rather haphazardly slotted in, there's a passage from an old religious plate. It describes<LINE>how the ferns were once hand-picked on the eve of moonrise from sacred grounds, coated in some sort of paste,<LINE>and left out on a carved board to dry before use.

Many of the spiritual methodologies described in the old texts involved gathering materials in this way. This act of<LINE>foraging for resources was a method of abstraction of the self. They said that by first drawing oneself close to the<LINE>animalistic natures that bind us to this plane, one could then more effectively transcend beyond them.

As industry advanced and void fluid became a commodity, though, these methods were all but abandoned by most.<LINE>Some still kept to the traditions, but by the time the iterator projects began, it was near impossible for them<LINE>to do so - the vast majority of harvesting grounds had either been replaced with automated growing plots for<LINE>increased efficiency, or were contaminated beyond repair. 

These ferns were artificially grown and harvested, of course. I suppose the<LINE>inclusion of this text was intended to make up for that.
