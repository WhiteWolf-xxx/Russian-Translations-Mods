CONVERSATION CHANNEL REROUTED, DISTENSION RESOLVED

EOC: ...as I was saying about the degrading systems.

WC: Fate truly has a way of instilling the most amusing misfortune upon us all. 

WC: Now, before our ties are crossed once more - how have you all been? 

EOC: Ah, not much has changed. Our Sliverist collective is still going strong, 

EOC: Someone going by 'Erratic Pulse' has been leaping about the channels, probing and prying about all<LINE>manners of things. Seems to have a real interest in self-ascension - or to be blunt, more of an obsession. 

WC: Any suspects?

EOC: Don't tell anyone, but I think it may be Five Pebbles.

WC: Oh, really? Moon's little brother?

EOC: Oh, if he were monitoring this channel right now he would be most displeased!

EOC: And yes, one and the same. He's not exactly subtle about it - barely even scrambled his chat codes, same colors and everything!

WC: And you really don't think everyone else is also aware?

EOC: They might be... I suppose nobody has much interest. We've had similar things happen before and nothing's ever come of them.

EOC: I'm equal parts amused and concerned myself. I just hope he doesn't end up doing something he regrets.
