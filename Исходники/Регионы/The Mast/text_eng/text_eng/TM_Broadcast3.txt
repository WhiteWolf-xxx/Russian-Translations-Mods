AA: Have you seen any movements in the expanse lately?

QR: Movements in what sense?

AA: I've seen some kind of large structure piercing the cloud layer here and there, far from any cans.

AA: It appears to be moving at quite a pace! It managed to encircle half of the western plateau in just a few cycles.

QR: How curious! Is it releasing any transmissions?

AA: I've not detected any signals from it, and it's too distant for my overseers to make out much visual detail...

AA: But unless I'm misaken, this image I captured seems to be none other than a Yellow monasterial cupola!

QR: Indeed it is! I'd recognise that design anywhere. What an odd place to see one!

QR: My guess would be a semi-functional translation column, or perhaps a construction drone, but most were decommissioned long ago.

QR: And that certainly doesn't explain the monasterial architecture...

QR: Unless... are you at all familiar with the Abacus?
