This pearl has been scrambled. But some information is still readable.<LINE>How lucky!

It has some plain text, let me read it for you<LINE>it seems to be from some kind of automated output log.

222-TEST B: Unit_ID 72001, title: LeviathanB. Cycle 32. condition:poor<LINE>Cycle 35. condition: decent<LINE>Cycle 63. condition: decent

The list goes on and on...

The only noteable thing is that the Units condition went from "great" to "eliminated" between cycle 175 and 178.<LINE>Certainly strange...

There are some notes here aswell discussing different colour pigments in aquatic organisms.<LINE>perhaps they were modifying them for fancy colours.

Its quite suspicious how a pearl with seemingly innocent contents was scrambeled, or perhaps it was done accidentaly.
