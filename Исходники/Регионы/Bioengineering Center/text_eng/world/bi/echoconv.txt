Yet another creature crawls in these lands.

Do you know? Do you know that this is where your ancestors came from?

We were able to create any life form. Any problem could be solved just by creating a new organism.

But while solving one problem, we moved further and further away from solving a more important one.

We were desperately trying to break the great cycle,<LINE>yet kept making more living creatures go through it.

I might be the reason you are here, standing in front of me.

How selfish of me.

I am sorry, little one. Find a way out.
