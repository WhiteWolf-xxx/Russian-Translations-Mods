It's just a regular text. Relatively new.

I guess you found this pearl in the bioengineering center.

It records a report on all the organisms created in the complex for several cycles. 

If you're interested in knowing, the bioengineering center is the place<LINE>where purposed organisms were previously produced and created. 

The main purpose of the complex was to provide the facility with purposed organisms.<LINE>They helped the machinery not to wear out and were quite an important part of our vital activity.

At the time when this pearl was recorded, the center mainly aimed at creating guards. 

The guards were the creatures that prevented the external fauna from entering my facility lands. 

On the pearl, the genome and anatomy of one of these creatures is painted in detail. 

An interesting solution was to give it the ability to fly.<LINE>This made it easier to detect and eliminate unwanted guests.

However, the guard must be strong enough to lift large creatures.<LINE>It is not so easy to achieve this with a pair of wings, so<LINE>the creators have found an alternative.

Glands that produce a special gas have been built into the organism of this creature.<LINE>If necessary, the guard sprayed this gas under high pressure, which gave him additional mobility.

You've probably come across one of these.

Previously, they did not hunt important creatures for the facility,<LINE>or caught them only where they are not needed to be.

Now the guards are most likely catching everything they can lift. 

Besides the guards, many more creatures were being produced at the bioengineering center.<LINE>Surely your distant ancestors were also created there.
