This is a test report from the nearby communication system base transformer. 

Little creature, how did you manage to get this? 

Let me describe it for you: 

"During our inspection process, we discovered that there were some minor faults in the communication system's transformer."

"When power supply interruption and restart occur, the transformer may not be able to effectively transmit electricity to the top of the communication system."

"Although blackouts are low probability events, this malfunction still warrants attention" 

...

It's hard to believe that the failure of the communications system was due to such an unassuming flaw. 

In any case, that place is dangerous, so little creatures like you should stay away from places like these.
