This report originates from the cooling system of a nearby communication tower. 

There, extremely cold coolant used to flow until power outage caused it to return to room temperature quickly. 

Subsequently, leakages in the coolant pipes led to heavy flooding in the area. 

In this humid environment, vegetation rapidly proliferated and formed a dense tropical rainforest. 

Nowadays, one can hardly recognize that the location was once home to a high-tech communications facility. 

I am curious about how you managed to reach such an isolated place.
