Little archaeologist, you must have found this pearl from the vicinity of the local communication tower, right?

This pearl is an experiment report

"Tests have shown that the heat dissipation efficiency of the experimental Titanium-containing organic material is much higher than that of water, and according to the preliminary calculations before the two cycles, the application of this fluid in the main signal generator of the experimental communication system can greatly extend its life..."

But I guess you don't understand the lab reports of these majors

But the coolant mentioned in the report is toxic, and as you may have noticed, there are a lot fewer small flying insects there, because they can't survive in this toxic environment

And, while the fluid is toxic, it's rich in nutrients, which may be one of the reasons for the rainforest
