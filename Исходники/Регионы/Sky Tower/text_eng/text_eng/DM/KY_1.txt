This is a test report from a nearby communication system base transformer.

Little Courier, how did you get this report?

Let me describe it to you:

"During the inspection, we found that there were some minor faults in the transformer of the communication system"

"When restarted after a power outage, the transformer may not be able to efficiently transmit power to the top part of the communication system"

"Although the outage is a low-probability event, this fault is still a cause for concern"

So that tower probably won't last long

...

But I think I might not see the day it fell
