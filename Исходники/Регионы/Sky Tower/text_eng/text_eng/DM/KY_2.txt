This report was sourced from a nearby communications tower cooling system.

There used to be an extremely cold coolant.

However, when power is cut off, the coolant quickly returns to room temperature.

Subsequently, there was a leak in the coolant pipes, causing the area to be flooded with a large amount of water.

In humid environments, vegetation grows rapidly, creating dense tropical rainforests.

Now, you can barely make out that it was once a high-tech communications facility.

I'm curious, how did you get there?
