It's a blueprint for a high-velocity train line. The trains are of an altered design to accomodate an entire gate structure within them.
The plans are labeled "Global Hyper-Transit System", described in the data as a method of facilitating travel between Iterators, no matter their location.
Something like this would surely be useful, but there is no way that the equipment of such a vast and complex mechanism would continue to function without regular mantinence, let alone an administrator to run it.
Still, one could always hope. How exciting it must be, to be able to go wherever you want!
Some of us... don't have that luxury.
I'm glad you do.
