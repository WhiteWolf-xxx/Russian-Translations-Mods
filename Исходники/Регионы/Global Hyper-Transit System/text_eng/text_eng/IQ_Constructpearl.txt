Interesting... this pearl outlines in great detail the reasons for an Iterator's altered design.
Although we are all unique in construction, some of us were built as "experimental units" to try to make further models more efficient.
It seems this one, "Expanses In Equilibrium", was an experiment to see if an Iterator would be more productive without the presence of an inhabited city on their exterior.
In doing so, this Iterator's inhabitants would live on the ground.
To solve the issue of the deadly rain produced by Iterators, they had a system that pumped this one's heat far away, keeping the surrounding area in its natural frigid state.
From a further signature, it seems the plans were approved and construction started.
I'm not quite sure what to do with this information... but I suppose it's fascinating nonetheless.
