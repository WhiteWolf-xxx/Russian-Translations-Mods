Amazing! This pearl contains notes on a civilization preceding that of the benefactors of my island.<LINE>These are archaeological writings about ancient ruins found under an urban area.
The authors describe their findings and the various artifacts they managed to unearth.<LINE>One passage describes how the lower layers of these ruins were flooded by void fluid.
They explain this anomaly by the proximity of a local rise of living rock.<LINE>According to them, the spirituality of the place would have succeeded in purifying this mixture! Strange postulate...
There is another passage telling how a team would have ventured deeper and found... ruins suspended in the sky!
Believe me, little creature, I have been researching my predecessors for countless cycles, but I have never read anything like this.

Some thinkers from the time when we still lived with our creators wrote a lot on the possibility of "layers of existence".<LINE>They would be connected to each other by the void sea and the firmament.
It would theoretically be possible to pass from one of these "layers" to another, by convoluted means that are rarely described in literature.
Have these archaeologists found one of these passages? It would be a revolution in the way of seeing our world!
There was a time when this type of discovery would have been seen as heretical, though. Be careful who you share this with!
