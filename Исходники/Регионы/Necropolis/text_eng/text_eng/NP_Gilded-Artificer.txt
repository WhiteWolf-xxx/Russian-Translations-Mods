What is this? Oh, an archaeological report from a region outside my facility.<LINE>The authors describe the junk they have unearthed there.
Only the last chapter seems to be of any interest to me.<LINE>A team claims to have found floating ruins in the sky in the lowest parts of the construction site.
It is very interesting.
This discovery joins forbidden theories on the functioning of our world, considered heretical.
According to some courageous thinkers, the world would be divided into layers of existence linked together.
The matter dissolved in the void sea would pour into the next layer in the form of dust falling from the firmament.
It would be possible for places particularly imbued with a karmic imbalance to resist this transformation...
From there to imagining that individuals could suffer the same fate, there is only one step.
A step that no one dared to take.
This subject was considered a great taboo.<LINE>Some believed that crossing the boundary between the layers of existence could lead to eternal life!
You can imagine that for a society obsessed with breaking the cycle of life, this was seen as an abominable heresy.
Thanks for bringing me this pearl, it will give me food for thought.
