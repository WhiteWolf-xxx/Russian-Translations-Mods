It contains an outline for a purposed organism,<LINE> a small companion beast meant to provide “therapeutic support” for a neighboring iterator.

The organism produces wool, which can be processed into yarn and knit into various garments.

There are proposals for both large scale machinery and smaller,<LINE> more portable machines intended for processing the wool,<LINE>and it intends to use a pre-established delivery system to collect and distribute the materials. 

Admittedly, I am rather curious as to how such a system functions,<LINE> but the author has neglected to elaborate.

I suppose it shall remain a mystery.

The rest of the document is dedicated to the construction of the organism itself,<LINE> such as it being “lightweight” and “easy to carry”, or possessing “sufficient articulation to operate machines involved<LINE> in the production of yarn and its resulting creations.” 

...Actually, it looks a lot like you, little creature!<LINE> How fascinating. I do hope they were successful.
