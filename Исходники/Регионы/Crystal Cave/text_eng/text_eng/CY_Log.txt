It’s an old conversation log.<LINE> I’m not familiar with the participants, but I’ll read it to you anyways.

“1537.600 - PRIVATE<LINE> Starlight Symphony, No Cost Too Great (Administrator)

NCTG: Blessed cycle, Starlight Symphony. Congratulations on the Local Group integration!<LINE> How are you adjusting to your superstructure? 

SLS: Oh, thank you, Director! Um… I’m not really sure. It’s a really scary and different experience.

NCTG: Is it? I thought you’d be a little more excited… After all, you finally get to feel like a god, yes? 

SLS: Um, yes, of course!! Sorry…! I’m very grateful!<LINE> But… I’ve never been part of something so… massive and all-encompassing before.<LINE> It makes me feel really small, and it’s difficult for me to navigate all of these menus and processes and… things, I guess.

NCTG: Ah, I see. I suppose that is understandable.<LINE> You needn’t worry, though—Your superstructure is fully capable of running and maintaining itself.<LINE> And if something goes wrong, you can always ask Perpetual Umbra or myself for assistance. 

SLS: Right, I understand. Thank you!! Um… Shouldn’t I be trying to learn to run things myself, though…?<LINE>I don’t feel like a real iterator…<LINE> I’m pretty sure normal iterators fully understand their systems, since they’re more than just a puppet.

NCTG: ...Is there something wrong with your superstructure?<LINE> Much like yourself, it is meant to be exceptional. Do you lack faith in my judgment?<LINE> Your superstructure is perfectly suited to your specific needs.<LINE> But, if it’s not good enough...

SLS: No, it’s perfect!! I’m very grateful!! I trust you, really! I just… Misunderstood,<LINE> I think… I apologize for overstepping; it won’t happen again!

NCTG: No worries, no worries! I’m glad we could clear up this misunderstanding.<LINE> I am certain you will be of great help to your peers. 

SLS: Thank you, Administrator. May I disconnect? 

NCTG: Of course.”

...There’s a lot I don’t understand, but something about this conversation worries me.
