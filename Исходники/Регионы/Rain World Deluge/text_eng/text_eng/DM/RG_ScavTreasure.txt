Interesting! This is a pearl dated around the time of the Void Fluid revolution, with a<LINE>charmingly simple encryption method that used to be the norm at the time.
I shall read it to you.

How dare You be so foolish?
Uncontainable He.
Insurmountable He.
You deign to unspool He?
Must You tame the Wind? Erect the Mountains?
Should You attempt at His Scales
You will be struck by Grand Spiritual Force
