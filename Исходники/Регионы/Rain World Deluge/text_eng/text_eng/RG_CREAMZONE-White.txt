Sonix: Before Creamsicle eggs became the main focus of the region,<LINE>I had originally planned to use the glowy vents in a giant main tower with<LINE>a red hot palette and steamhazards in a subregion called “The Heart”,<LINE>where the machinery was blindingly hot and nothing dared to enter.<LINE>Lots of tough platforming with said steam.
Sonix: I decided against it after hatchlings were added, turning once unexplained<LINE>glowing vents into heat sinks which now act as fully-functional incubators that the<LINE>creamsicles utilize in communal nests. You can even find a few abandoned nest<LINE>rooms in areas they didn’t like enough!
Sonix: There’s a screenshot of a concept room from The Heart floating around somewhere,<LINE>I bet you could find it if you know where to ask. 
Sonix: I really love using OE Spheres in ways the devs didn’t intend, but I’m glad there's<LINE>a proper explanation for them instead of just pretty setpieces with zero depth.
