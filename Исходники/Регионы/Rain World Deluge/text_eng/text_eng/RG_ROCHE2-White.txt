Sonix: This room was made by the ever-talented Klumquart! 
Sonix: ...But I bet that was obvious, Klum's style is amazing and very recognizable haha
Sonix: Klum is the creator of the Shrouded Assembly mod, and you can find decals I made in Saint's timeline of Steaming Edifice!
Sonix: So I suppose this was Klum's half of a trade? Either way, very fun to work with the fulcher himself
