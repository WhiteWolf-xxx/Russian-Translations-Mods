Sonix: This room was made by the talented Tryn1010!
Sonix: Tryn was in the middle of moving everything she owned, and still cooked with this room.
Sonix: I would SO buckle under pressure like that hahaha
Sonix: I knew the middle area would be really fun to add Graffiti to, and devtooling this room was such a treat.
Sonix: Check Tryn out on YT, she makes music and is working on her own large scale mod!
