Ah...

This is a junk pearl from a transcription line. It was created by accident due to a common issue in the process of a fully-automated pearl line. 

Iterators themselves can transcribe pearls just fine, however some Data Banks on the surface still opted<LINE>to include transcription lines for bulk production and physical storage alongside the digital storage units. 

An oversight in the design paired with a single line of erroneous code would lead to the confirmation order itself getting transcribed to a pearl<LINE>instead of being sent to the Headmaster overseeing the facility grounds.

However, as the confirmation would appear unsent, the facility would attempt to send the confirmation alongside the contents of the previous pearl once moreâ€¦ 

In the case of this pearl, the confirmations are repeated for four-thousand six hundred and twenty-eight lines.
