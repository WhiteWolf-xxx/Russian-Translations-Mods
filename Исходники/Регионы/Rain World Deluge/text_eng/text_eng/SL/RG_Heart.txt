This pearl contains a poem lamenting about the state that a well known meditation retreat in the west had fallen into. 

I remember the event that spawned this, it was widespread news in both the neighboring cities as well as the structures they were built atop of.

Our creators argued on either side with a fervor, those more religious and spiritually inclined furious at the treatment of such a holy site,<LINE>and those on the side of industrial spread and technological advancement preached on how such a powerful tool for their local iterator would drastically increase everybodyâ€™s way of life.

The iterators, on the other hand, were simply... Exceedingly jealous. 

The temple was being demolished to make space for three towering data banks that would be hooked up to the local Iterator; Three Small Frogs. 

They were... Quite advanced, to say the least. Each tower was fitted with state of the art heat sinks for thermal regulation-<LINE>something the more dated iterator models didn't even have. I know I would have greatly benefited from them in my time of need.

Groups that opposed such unfair treatment popped up left right and centre during the construction period, but like most issues, inevitably died down as more pressing ones emerged.

Not long after the construction of the towers ended, those in charge declared the lands were still consecrated holy grounds and were to be respected as such... 

...Despite the fact that the temple was completely paved over and buried in heaps of liquid concrete.

That reignited discussion from all fields again for a little while...
