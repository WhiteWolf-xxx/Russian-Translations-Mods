This is a large amount of data that was automatically compiled from a forum, all originating from the same<LINE>residential block signature within the city of Three Small Frogs. 

Most of these are requests for infrastructure repair, many submitted multiple times slightly reworded. Others share the same phrase chanted over and over.

Some are ratherâ€¦ profane.

They seem to hold their Iterator in incredibly high regard, but lack said respect for their Grand Headmasters for allowing certain issues to continue.

It appears that the contents of said forums were all automatically flagged for deletion, and only transcribed onto<LINE>a pearl long after the forums were closed, and an archive was picked up by an automated pearl transcription line, 

likely just pulling any data it can to transcribe onto a pearl.

I doubt that whoever these complaints were meant for ever saw them.

Not for lack of trying though, it seems.
