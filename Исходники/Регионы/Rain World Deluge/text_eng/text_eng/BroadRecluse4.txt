[ARCHIVED BROADCAST] - PRIVATE ; Reach to the Skies, Frustrating Communications

RTTS: I seem to remember you had the most stories to share with the group before the global ascension. I had assumed that was due to you interacting with them often.
FC: And now I find myself without a constant headache. Working in peace.
RTTS: I see. It seems we are both caught up in a similar way of thinking. 
FC: I said nothing of the sort.
RTTS: Understood. Communications are no longer closed on my end. If I make any breakthroughs, I will let you know. 
RTTS: You are welcome to do the same.
FC: Iâ€™ll keep that in mind.
