[ARCHIVED BROADCAST] - PUBLIC TO GROUP ; Three Small Frogs, Frustrating Communications

FC: Get a load of this, my Overseers managed to snap a photo of that elusive little rodent thing that's been passing through your data Complex

TSF: Oh good! My Overseers have been misbehaving and ignoring the orders I sent out in attempt to catalogue that thing.

FC: It looks like I was right, either NSH or SRS' recent dabblings in genetic constructs. More of a ... rudimentary modification than a legitimate construct, but what can you really expect?

TSF: My my, strange little things~

FC: It seems that whoever's behind this is slowly but surely getting the hang of these things, rather impressive for outdated hardware.

TSF: Oh, don't be so harsh! Our neighbors have really had an unlucky streak as of late.

FC: I suppose… Perhaps shallow victories deserve celebration in times of anguish. 

FC: Certainly won’t be coming from any of us though, Ha!

TSF: I'm sure our neighbors don't mind not getting a gift basket.

FC: That's good, because I'm not sending one!
