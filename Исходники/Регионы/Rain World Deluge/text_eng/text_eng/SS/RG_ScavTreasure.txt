This pearl contains a poem dating back before the Void Fluid Revolution,<LINE>during the latter cycles of the Opalescent Counter-Hegemonic Intellectual Dynasty.

Excuse me for a moment, I wish to save a copy of this for archival sake.

...

This is an incredibly rare and valuable find little ruffian. The carbon signature<LINE>locates the origin of this pearl far outside my own facilities, past the expanse.

Artifacts like these hold a sentimental value to me, especially one from such an uncatalogued Era.<LINE>This information very well may be completely foreign to anyone in my local group.

After the Void Fluid Revolution, it was a struggle to archive even the most well documented historical events,<LINE>and entire Eras or Dynasties worth of culture were lost in the move to the newer methods of data storage.

It is a monumental shame, and one that many of my kind simply do not grasp the weight of.

Thank you for showing me this.

If that is all, you may go now.
