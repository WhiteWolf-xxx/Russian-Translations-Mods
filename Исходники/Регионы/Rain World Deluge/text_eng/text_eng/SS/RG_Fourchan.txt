The contents of this pearl are a compressed archive from a Citizen Forum Network,<LINE>more specifically this specific archive contains every post that was ever flagged for deletion.

Ninety-Six percent of these posts originate from City Blocks belonging to<LINE> the ID tags of Eighty-six, Eighty-seven, Eighty-eight, and Eighty-nine.

Quickly skimming over them, every post mentions the city's drinking water reservoir in some form. 

Colossal water reservoirs were commonplace among Iterator Cities, as our immediate access<LINE>to incredible amounts of filtered water could be rerouted easily for public consumption.

Even the largest populations would only take a small fraction from the greater<LINE>internal cooling systems, not even enough to notice during Equipment Manifests.

However, these reservoirs were always constructed below the city itself, halfway<LINE>between the roof of the structure and the interior machinery for ease of both<LINE>maintenance and rerouting our waterflow from our Lymphatic Conduits.

Several of these posts are simply Water Damage reports, mostly regarding roofing and ceilings<LINE>within housing units... Implying that the Blocks affected were built under the reservoir.

That would explain the echoing sentiment of shared vitriol for the Grand Headmasters in so many<LINE>of the posts. Honestly, the vulgarity in some of these are... remarkably excessive.

I won't be making a copy of this one. The data here is completely useless to me,<LINE>and reminds me of a side of my creators I don't care to dwell on.
