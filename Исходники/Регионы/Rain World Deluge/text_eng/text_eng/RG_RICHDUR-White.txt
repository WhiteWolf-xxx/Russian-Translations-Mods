I dedicate this room to Richard, the first friend I truly made and kept.
I wish I was able to spend more time with you before the end, for that I am sorry.
But I am so grateful that the last moments we shared together were full of laughs and joy.
Thank you for sticking by me through thick and thin, even when most wouldn't have.
You truly were an amazing friend. The best I could have asked for.
Rest well, and thank you for everything.
