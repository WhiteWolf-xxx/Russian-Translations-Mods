Sonix: Willburd is definitely my modding hero.
Sonix: I got into modding in 2019 after seeing The Root.
Sonix: It was like crack to me hahaha, Sky Islands palette was my absolute favorite and I always wanted a region<LINE>that had that look to it but didn’t make me pull my hair out like SI platforming did.
Sonix: Will managed to so perfectly encapsulate the vanilla style, and so perfectly expand on base RW.
Sonix: I was dumbfounded, and it really excited me that all the tools used were available to me.
Sonix: Fast forward a few years, and once again Will’s work on MSC pushes me to get back into modding this game.
Sonix: I owe a lot to that guy.
