[ARCHIVED BROADCAST] - PRIVATE ; Frustrating Communications, Three Small Frogs

FC: Your overseers have been sharing increasingly useless information with the few of mine that have drifted into your facility grounds.

FC: ... 

FC: ...Respect you?

TSF: The majority of my Overseers ignore my requests for surveillance in the tower grounds, my Equipment Manifests state<LINE>there has been a 62% decrease in Species Cataloguing within my Facility grounds,<LINE>and worst of all it takes my Overseers far too long to display the hotspots I enjoy watching in my free time!!

TSF: They’ve become so unruly! Not twenty cycles ago I learned incredibly important information regarding my<LINE>Data Complex from Thinking Debris complaining about the exact same thing you are.

FC: Hilarious. Perhaps they considered our Senior’s opinion more important than your own.

FC: Oh. That might be a good enough reason to watch the muck outside.
