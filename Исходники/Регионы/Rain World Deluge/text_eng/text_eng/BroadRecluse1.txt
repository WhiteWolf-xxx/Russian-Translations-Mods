[ARCHIVED BROADCAST] - PRIVATE ; Reach to the Skies, Frustrating Communications

FC: Hah!
RTTS: Hello to you too. What is so funny?
FC: Well, I’d long since mourned and moved on from your death, so I thought I finally lost it like that old kook if I was hallucinating getting messages from a ghost.
RTTS: You assumed I died in my absence? Your can is close enough to mine that your Overseers could have confirmed that wasn’t the case.
FC: ...Seems like you didn’t work on your sense of humor. If it's not to haunt me, What rouses you from your one hundred cycle sabbatical?
RTTS: It was only Eighty-Two. And I certainly wouldn’t call it a sabbatical.
FC: Right.
