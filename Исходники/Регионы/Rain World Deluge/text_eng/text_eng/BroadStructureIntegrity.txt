[ARCHIVED BROADCAST] - PRIVATE ; Frustrating Communications, Three Small Frogs

FC: Hey. Thinking Debris offhandedly mentioned there might be some… issues with your equipment… What’s that all about?

TSF: Oh yes! I neglected to mention it the last time we spoke. During a routine data cleanse of my Neural Relay Interface<LINE>there was a strange blip in my hardware which resulted in the implosion of some machinery in my South-Western Processing Nodes.

FC: That- That sounds bad. 
FC: You… seem to be taking this rather well. 

TSF: What ever do you mean?

FC: Well, we aren’t indestructible you know.

TSF: Of course I know that, it’s only natural that hardware eroded with the passage of time.<LINE>That’s why it’s important to practice consistent and proper maintenance. 

FC: You- No- Frogs, Take Looks to the Moon for example. Have you seen the images Unparalleled Innocence<LINE>has been spreading? I would be hard-pressed to say that wreckage even resembles a can!

TSF: It truly is awful that she was not retrofitted with the same repair drones that I possess.

FC: ...
FC: I do not believe they would be effective.

TSF: Are you worried about me? I can reassure you that my Dendrites are hard at work to seal this up! Besides,<LINE>my diagnostic said there was nothing to worry about! 
TSF: Paraphrasing, of course.

FC: Right.
