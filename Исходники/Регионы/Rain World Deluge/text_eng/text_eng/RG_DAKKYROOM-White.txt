Sonix: This room was made by a homosexual man who is known for plundering gold and commandeering ships.
Sonix: OH! Sorry, that info shouldn't be public!!
Sonix: This room was made by Dakras, a legacy modder who was interested in Rain World before I even graduated grade school.
Sonix: Dak is a huge homie, and I love him a ton. I really wanted to see the king himself make an RG room.
Sonix: I admit I was... super persistent, maybe a bit too much at times. But I'm so glad he ended up making this. Such a fun layout.
