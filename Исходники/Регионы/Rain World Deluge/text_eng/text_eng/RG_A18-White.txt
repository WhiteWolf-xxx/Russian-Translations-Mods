Sonix: For a lot of RG’s development, I didn't share anything with the RW community.
Sonix: (Not counting the “initial” initial reveal trailer, which was a blatant shitpost that I'm amazed got me into some private modding discords.)
Sonix: But for a select few of my friends, they saw pretty much every room get made, and I posted almost daily about anything and everything RG related.
Sonix: This room benefited greatly from their initial help when I sucked at tiling. 
Sonix: I love you guys, thanks for stickin’ with me
