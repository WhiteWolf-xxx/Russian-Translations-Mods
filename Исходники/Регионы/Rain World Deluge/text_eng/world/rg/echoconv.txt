Here I sat, in solidarity. Bound in both body and mind. Willingly.
Not one that came, not before nor after, could match my dedication.
Prancing like fools in hopes of attaining a fraction of what I so effortlessly achieved! The gall! What could they know?
Cycles upon cycles! Perpetual! Unending! Perfected Meditation!
In an expanse of frigid, flooding misery, no less. Steeped in muck, yet not one finger raised, not one word of discontent!
I deserved it...
And yet...
here I sit,
...
Alone.
