The flow...

surrounding the vast world behind me...

A seemingly endless supply of clean and fresh water...

Where did it go? Did we take too much?

The boundaries between need and greed were fusing...

Guided by our selfish minds... ruining everything around us, to the point where we were wrecks ourselves...

We deserve to be here. Stuck in our world forever, reminded of our mistakes.

And unable to fix them.
