Oh, at first glance this is just a common poem like the sorts written by those up until my creators' departure, but there are some things about it that stand out to me and make it clear it's much more than just that! 

You see, my inhabitants had a stratified living caste, with some living in or below the towering concrete housing blocks directly next to myself, and the richer folks living atop the roof of my structure.<LINE>Though their civilization was hardly ever prone to violent conflict, this rather unusual situation led to the occasional protest or even rebellious crime. 

When I came into existence, most of the individuals I had contact with were among the affluent houses. 

I was sometimes tasked with assisting them in cracking down into this sort of criminal activity.<LINE>I had no choice but to screen the many pieces of literature commonly traded amongst citizens to uncover hidden meanings within seemingly innocent poems.<LINE>I believe this is one of such pearls used to coordinate rebel activity, hidden in plain sight. 

Here, let me break it down for you:

"With wings, ever-so Brilliant,<LINE>we soar, Soar yet ever-higher,<LINE>Twelve, Eight, Thirty-Seven leagues above,<LINE>Clouds below (Unfathomably distant),"

The numbers mentioned here is likely some sort of address, and Clouds Below, Unfathomably Distant could be someone's pseudonym.<LINE>It seems they went to the luxurious rooftop settlements with whatever these 'brilliant wings' are, but I'm not sure what they exactly mean.

"Even higher, Grazing the stars,<LINE>picking glistening blossoms forth,<LINE>from the Heavenly Garden above,<LINE>And One, by One, we glide Back down to brew,<LINE>priceless wines from starlight fruit,"

This seems to rather blatantly reference a structure far above my structure, higher than even the most noble citizens' living places, a very special garden of sorts.<LINE>It's clear now that this pearl is a plan to steal something that was growing there, though it's honestly perplexing to me as to why it's so obvious here.<LINE>I'm sure anyone could tell even without bringing it to me for higher-level analysis!

"To embibe and laugh as we watch,<LINE>the Gilded Wings we once flew upon,<LINE>Scatter into countless Stars and Feathers,"

Oh, if I'm understanding this right, the final line could actually imply something much more than just stealing fruits.<LINE>Wait, it's all making sense now! 

In this situation, the roof-dwellers affluence was also to the benefit of the lower-class inhabitants, ironically.

I've mentioned before what Void Fluid is, right? For a while only the mightest could afford to ascend and leave this world behind.<LINE>And as the cycles went on, the population decline was much sharper upon the higher class than the inhabitants of the waterlogged residential structures below.

The confidence of whoever wrote this pearl to be much more mask-off with their message would make sense, if it was written at a time when those below far outnumbered whoever remained above the clouds.<LINE>Even if they found out, what could a few nobles do against the many people who were getting increasingly more fed up with their social disparity? 

But in the end, this plan to sabotage the Garden never bore fruit,<LINE>as eventually advancements in Void Fluid technology meant even the poorest laborers could afford to ascend in the same comfort the prestigious houses once bathed in.<LINE>What an interesting find, little explorer!
