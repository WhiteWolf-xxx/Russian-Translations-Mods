An interesting find! This is an assembly manifest for a growing pod.

What is a growing pod, you might ask? Well, they are small, partially organic capsules, designed to simulate developmental conditions<LINE>without the need for an independent organism. Many organisms of the past were produced using these methods, due to how much more<LINE>efficient they are when compared to standard reproductive processes. 

To put it simply, growth pods are probably where your ancestors were born!

But the ones described in these plans aren't exactly designed to breed your kind.<LINE>This is a large model, for aerial organisms living in urban environments.

My citizens used them frequently as pest control. I hope they're not around to catch you anymore!

No offense meant, of course.
