It's a poem, with short stanzas and complex yet vague descriptors commonly seen in modern literature up until the Mass Ascension. 

The poem seems to describe an aeronautical excursion reaching the star-like heights, taking something important from above, to then abandon their vessel up there as they return and rejoice. 

Despite the long and proven history of the Void Sea and the countless uses of Void Fluid, there was a small group of contrarians who believed the answer to the Great Problem lied in the heavens above rather than deep below. 

Although the terminology doesn't quite line up, perhaps this poem here was written by such star-searchers,<LINE>and whatever they supposedly found up there and used for their benefit was some sort of analog to the Void Fluid they (in reality) used to power their great civilization. 

I must admit this is a rather amusing find.
