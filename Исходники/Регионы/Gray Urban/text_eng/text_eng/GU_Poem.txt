This pearl appears to contain some sort of poem, but I have no clue to its meaning.<LINE>Don't worry, I can still read it out to you:

"With wings, ever-so Brilliant,<LINE>we soar, Soar yet ever-higher,<LINE>Twelve, Eight, Thirty-Seven leagues above,<LINE>Clouds below (Unfathomably distant),<LINE>Even higher, Grazing the stars,<LINE>picking glistening blossoms forth,<LINE>from the Heavenly Garden above,<LINE>And One, by One, we glide Back down to brew,<LINE>priceless wines from starlight fruit,<LINE>To embibe and laugh as we watch,<LINE>the Gilded Wings we once flew upon,<LINE>Scatter into countless Stars and Feathers,"

I'm sorry I can't offer more insight on this specific poem, I don't recognize it in the slightest!<LINE>But given its rather modern jargon and little weathering, I reckon it was written by the inhabitants of some city, and traded amongst them.

When they weren't trying to find a better way to leave this world behind, people would do all sorts of strange activities to pass the time, with poetry being quite popular into many social circles.<LINE>Often times they would even ask for inspiration or assistance with writing their lines, or just to practice reciting them before important reading ceremonies. 

While it certaintly became annoying after the thousandth cycle, I can't blame them for finding interest in such literature!
