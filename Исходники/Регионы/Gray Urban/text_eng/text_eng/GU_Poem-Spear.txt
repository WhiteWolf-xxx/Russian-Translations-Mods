This pearl appears to contain a simple poem of sorts, likely traded amongst the inhabitants of a city up until the mass ascension.<LINE>I don't recognize it or the importance to its meaning, but I'll still read it out to you nevertheless:

"With wings, ever-so Brilliant,<LINE>we soar, Soar yet ever-higher,<LINE>Twelve, Eight, Thirty-Seven leagues above,<LINE>Clouds below (Unfathomably distant),<LINE>Even higher, Grazing the stars,<LINE>picking glistening blossoms forth,<LINE>from the Heavenly Garden above,<LINE>And One, by One, we glide Back down to brew,<LINE>priceless wines from starlight fruit,<LINE>To embibe and laugh as we watch,<LINE>the Gilded Wings we once flew upon,<LINE>Scatter into countless Stars and Feathers,"

Thank you, I guess, little messenger.<LINE>Normally reading these poems from my creators would be a chore, but in this dire situation, it does bring a weird sense of comfort.
