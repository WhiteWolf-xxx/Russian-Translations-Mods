This pearl has been authored by a Caretaker of Five pebbles.<LINE>It contains an image of, get this, Five Pebbles and one of his Caretakers in Christmas attire!

With the text 'Merry Christmas from our family to yours!' accompanying it!

I suspect Five Pebbles must have discarded this pearl out of embarrassment after his entourage finally ascended.

Please keep this one safe for me, it is very funny to look at.
