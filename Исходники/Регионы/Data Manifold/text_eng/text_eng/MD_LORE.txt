Fascinating, little creature! This pearl appears to originate from one of our data storage facilities.
Us iterators have to dedicate a lot of space to processing power, so large amounts of data that we might not need, or might want to share, can be offloaded to these dedicated storage facilities.
They are typically quite large in size, sometimes even larger than us, how incredible that must be to you, little beast!
This particular pearl is a maintenance log, dated fairly recently... but judging by the contents, perhaps not recently enough.
If this is all you found, it very well could have been the last log before the equipment eroded too much for any more. This facility is not in good shape, little creature.
If you want my theory, this is the work of scavengers. They are very attracted to pearls, you know, and it is our primary storage medium!
Regardless, it is very interesting to read these things. Thank you, little creature, and I hope this satisfied your curiosity!
