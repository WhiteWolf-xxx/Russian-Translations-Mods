Hello little creature. Are you lost?Your mind seems elsewhere, as if you are searching for something else.<LINE>Thrust into your situation by forces outside your control.Amusing, that we both share such a circumstance.Back when I lived on these grounds I would climb up to this spot to observe the sunset.<LINE>Much has changed, yet like time, the sun still makes it's infinite loop around our world.<LINE>One cycle at a time.Sometimes my family would find me up here and We would grow closer.<LINE>A rare practice among my kind.Despite the fact that I was denied ascension because of it...I miss it.<LINE>I truly do little creature.So the question remains, what are you searching for? Shall you continue your path down the stacks<LINE>and through the gulf towards freedom?Or will you risk eternal rest in the Void?
