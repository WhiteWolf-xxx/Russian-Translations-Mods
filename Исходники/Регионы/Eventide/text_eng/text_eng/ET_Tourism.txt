It's a map of seismic activity around a popular tourist attraction from years before my creation.

Such places where deemed obsolete if not shameful to be visited<LINE>or used as my creators shifted to a much more karmic view of the world following the agnostic period
They were thought to be directly against the belief that one's own pleasures should be denied<LINE>as they encouraged individuals to spoil themselves or grow too attached to the shoreline.

As such, the sites were abandoned, allowing an influx of strange flora to take hold. As you might expect, their integrity suffered for it.

There is one other thing about this pearl that strikes me as peculiar - It has been eroded by a great variety of elements.<LINE>Some of the erosion seems much more recent as well

Judging by the barnacles and uneven texture I am led to believe that it has been sitting near some body of water for quite some time. Perhaps the northwestern crescent?
So that's where this pearl is from... You are very brave to have been able to make it all this way back!
