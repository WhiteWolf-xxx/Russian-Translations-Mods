It's a log detailing a batch of cargo freights through an area of my and Five Pebbles' facility grounds.<LINE>It appears to still have data from a rather recent time frame, as little as 6 cycles ago. How odd...

It's a rather long and extensive line of commands, data, schematics - nothing of interest to either you or me.<LINE>However the most recent lines are a bit more curious.

And the equipment manifest continues from there...

It's astonishing how this log has managed to continue its routine checks, despite its state of decay.

It really is interesting to me how much my creators wished to be organized and all-knowing.<LINE>So much done to ensure that no information would be lost or destroyed, and yet the only things that remain of them are their ruins and logs.

There's me and the others too of course, but even we will be lost to the void soon.

I'm sorry if I sound morbid little creature. It just saddens me to think of all the good that will be forgotten.<LINE>Though I suppose my creators wouldn't have had much to share in that regard anyway.
