This pearl appears to be a conversation log, or a journal of sorts, between a family of my creators<LINE>This is a lucky find little creature!

Many ancients believed that the only way to ascend fully was to leave behind all material posessions and relationships.<LINE>It is a shame that this benefactor's family was likely denied ascension because of that fact...

This particular family seemed to care for each other very much...

One more thing- there appears to be a mention of the number "13" with text before it written in a foreign language...<LINE>I've never seen anything like it.

Quite strange indeed.
