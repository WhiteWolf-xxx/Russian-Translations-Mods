(Red,Gourmand,Spear,Rivulet,White,Yellow,Artificer)Oh? What are you? A little rodent?

(Red,Gourmand,Spear,Rivulet,White,Yellow,Artificer)A pilgrim, a traveller, just as lost as the rest of us?

(Red,Gourmand,Spear,Rivulet,White,Yellow,Artificer)You now stand upon our great monument, a temple unto the self.<LINE> Only by living and indulging in our urges could we begin to understand their loss.

(Red,Gourmand,Spear,Rivulet,White,Yellow,Artificer)How does one understand starvation if one has never feasted?<LINE> How does one recognize poverty if they have never partaken in all the luxuries there are?

(Red,Gourmand,Spear,Rivulet,White,Yellow,Artificer)Whether we were right or wrong, it matters not. In the end it claimed us all. 

(Red,Gourmand,Spear,Rivulet,White,Yellow,Artificer)But, given my unique oppurtunity, I'd much rather an eternity of our greatest masterpiece<LINE> than the silence within those golden waters. Wouldn't you agree?

(Saint)Welcome!

(Saint)Revel in this exquisite moment with me, little mouse! 

(Saint)Our monument to hedonistic excess still stands, lingering, floating above just like we do.

(Saint)Like you might, if you had any sense!

(Saint)This sanctuary was the exception- for the seldom few not utterly deranged- the only ones who lived!<LINE> The only ones that felt GOOD!

(Saint)Why shouldn't you?
