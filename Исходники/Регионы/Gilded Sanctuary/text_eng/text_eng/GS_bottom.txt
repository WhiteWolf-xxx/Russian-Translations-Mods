Hm, this pearl is completely blank, and seemingly melted.<LINE> Where did you find this?

The degradation on the outer shell is reminiscent of a type of data purging popularized with my creators,<LINE> mostly impractical, but symbolic of the absolute power they held over information. 

It used a very refined type of void fluid, but judging from the mottled corrosion, this was raw and unrefined.

How truly remarkable that a little creature such as yourself would be able to find this,<LINE> and the depths you must have had to return from!

Thank you for this curious trinket, I deeply appreciate it.
