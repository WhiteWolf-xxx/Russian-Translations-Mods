Ah, it's a diary of sorts from a long time ago.<LINE>Most of it is unreadable, but I can make out a few lines.

"...recent surveys show a second well of void fluid unusually close to extraction site 44-S-B.<LINE> Unfortunately, this well is located at the bottom of the local water reservoir.

Despite this setback, construction for on-site living quarters is underway, and mining operations have already begun.

There are some concerns for the stability of a mine in such a location, but the prospect of a new void fluid source eases the worker's concerns.

In other news, the surface tower is being decommissioned, something about it interfering with the nearby lighthouse.<LINE> Even though it was a prototype, I'm still sad to see it abandoned.<LINE> Always did enjoy the view."
