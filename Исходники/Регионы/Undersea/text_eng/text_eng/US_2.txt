0-2It's an incident report marked with an important digital seal. Let me read it to you:"Unfortunately, mining site 45-U-S has been deemed beyond repair.<LINE> As you all know, the intense water pressure caused the void fluid to be far more unstable than it should've been.It is not entirely clear what triggered the explosion that caused the cave-in, but loss of life was minimal.Because of the immense dangers that would be present in any attempt to repair the mine, it was unanimously decided that we begin evacuating the living complex and instead focus our efforts on the other extraction well.It was an honor to work with you all, and I hope to see you again at site 44-S-B."
