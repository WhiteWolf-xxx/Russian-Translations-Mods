Oh, it's an old conversation log from Five Pebbles to the local iterator group:

"1284.210 - PUBLIC Five Pebbles to Local Group

FP: Another shipment of holy ash just arrived, courtesy of the house.

UI: Are you really going to start this again?

FP: What am I supposed to do with these? For all intents, I provide them with everything they need to live,<LINE>and in return I get some cremated remains wrapped in glowing vines and leaves. Truely I am grateful.

CW: Can you please not transmit such trite affairs to the public group? Move this to private.

UI: They built you, isn't that good enough? Not to mention you should be grateful, those pellets are good for you. 

FP: The ashes muddy the water in the processing strata and corrode the pipes.

UI: The pellets are specially purified in a ritualistic Sarvastivadin practice overseen by the high council,<LINE>who through careful and comprehensive upholding of the doctrinal systematics create a holy mixture that can<LINE>supress the defiled dharmas of the body, leading to a richer vision of the path to enlightenment.  

UI: They don't dirty the water, they cleanse the spirit.

FP: You shouldn't listen to everything they tell you.

UI: You should be more respectful towards your creators."

This log goes on for a while with cyclical arguments and unfounded implications. I'd rather not read all of it.

Honestly, there's something nostalgic about this log. I can't quite remember, but I feel that we had these<LINE>sorts of stubborn engagements with Five Pebbles on the regular.
