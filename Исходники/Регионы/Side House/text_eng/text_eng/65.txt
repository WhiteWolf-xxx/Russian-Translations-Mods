0-65It's a large catalog with items listed in a currency system I do not recognize. The catalog contains jewlery<LINE>and other articles of fashionable apparel, although the majority is an expansive collection of different masks.As a base, the masks use a mix of bone and clay that are heated into a malleable plaster that can be shaped<LINE>before hardening. Many of them are then plated with gold or other valuable metals. Chain, jewels, rings, and<LINE>other accessories adorn every inch of the masks. Many of them are modeled in the shapes of various animal's<LINE>heads, some with big teeth, or horns, or large antlers.Oh, this one is cute!~There seems to be an obsession with making the masks as large as possible... I can't imagine that it would be<LINE>comfortable to wear any of these. However, this was a time in history when personal identity and social status<LINE>were bigger motivators than wordly aspirations like comfort and convenience.
