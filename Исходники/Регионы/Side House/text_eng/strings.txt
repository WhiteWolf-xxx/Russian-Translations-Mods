The region is an amalgamation of many of the map files in the game data that went unused in the final game.<LINE>The region also contains two colored pearls that can be found and given as a gift to Moon. These pearls are unique to this region with their own lore text. One (purple) is about the average difficulty to obtain as most colored pearls. However, the other (cyan) is meant for players looking for a challenge.<LINE>The mod also comes with two new maps that can be unlocked for arena/sandbox mode.<LINE>This mod was created by AndrewFM, with custom threat music by Mikronaut.'
