...Oh, I'm so sorry, I cannot read the data in this pearl. It appears to have been thoroughly encrypted, it's all just meaningless numbers and symbols.<LINE>My data storage and translation systems are far too primitive to decipher this.

Someone very dedicated must have really not wanted whatever was in this pearl to be discovered.

Hmm... Perhaps Five Pebbles would have fared better with this. He's one of the newer models, you know. Their capabilities far exceed that of my generation.<LINE>Although, given his current situation I doubt you could possibly convince him to help.

I suppose this will just have to remain a mystery for us, unfortunately.
