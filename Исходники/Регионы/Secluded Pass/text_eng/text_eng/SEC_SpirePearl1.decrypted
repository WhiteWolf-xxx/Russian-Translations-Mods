...Oh, I'm so sorry, I cannot read the data in this pearl. It appears to have been thoroughly encrypted, it's all just meaningless numbers and symbols.<LINE>I don't think I could have deciphered this even before my collapse, when all of my systems were still in working order.

Someone very dedicated must have really not wanted whatever was in this pearl to be discovered.

Hmm... Perhaps Five Pebbles would have fared better with this. He's one of the newer models, you know. Their data storage and translation capabilities<LINE>far exceed my generation. Although, given his current situation I doubt you could possibly convince him to help.

I suppose this will just have to remain a mystery for us, unfortunately.
