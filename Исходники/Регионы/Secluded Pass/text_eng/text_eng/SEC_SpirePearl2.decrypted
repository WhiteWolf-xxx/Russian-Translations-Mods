This is a recording of a very old hymn, from before the time of the Void Fluid revolution. Like most things from that era, it's about the cycle of life and death.

The hymn starts with a simple melody, representing the thoughts of a lowly insect. As it continues, the melody becomes more and more grand,<LINE>until the insect dies and is reborn into a higher form of life. The hymn then repeats itself, but now with a slightly different, more complex melody.

The final loop of the hymn ends with a grand conclusion, representing the insect's ascension after reaching enlightenment.<LINE>Of course, without Void Fluid there wouldn't have actually been a guaranteed method of ascension, but the monks who created this hymn clearly thought otherwise.
