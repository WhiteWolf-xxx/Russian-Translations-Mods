0-SEC_SpirePearl1-ArtificerThe data in this pearl has been obscured by a powerful encryption. I can only barely make out the header, which suggests it was once a recording<LINE>of an emergency broadcast of some kind. I don't recognize the name of the sender, so this must have been sent by someone from far outside the local group.I don't know why something like this would have been blocked by the filters. It must have contained some sort of prohibited data, or perhaps someone<LINE>impersonated an administrator to make it seem that way. I suppose I could try to decrypt this, but that would take time. Something I do not possess in abundance....Besides, this message was sent a long time ago. Whatever was inside probably doesn't really matter anymore.
