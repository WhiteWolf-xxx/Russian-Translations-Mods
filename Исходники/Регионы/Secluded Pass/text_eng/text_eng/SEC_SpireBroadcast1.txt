MESSAGE CONTENTS:

CW: Five Pebbles, is this message reaching you?

CW: I just want you to know, we are all still trying to help you. 

CW: Suns and I have been asking around in the public forums for anyone who might know a cure for your affliction.

CW: We haven't found anything yet, but we are both still hopeful that a known remedy must exist somewhere.

CW: You are not the first to be infected by the Rot, after all. And others have recovered from it before.

CW: What is clear to us now is that, for anything substantial to be done, we need your cooperation on this.

CW: So please... Reopen your communication channels. You cannot solve this alone.
