Oh, this is a recording of a hymn from the proto-industrial era prior to the Void Fluid revolution. I already have a copy of it in my database,<LINE>but I suppose I should thank you anyways.

Do you... want me to explain it? I doubt you would be very interested. It's about the cycle of life and death,<LINE>and how lesser creatures slowly reincarnate into greater ones through the gathering of karmic energy.

The monks of that time believed that with enough of it, one could even ascend through the power of faith alone.<LINE>A misguided perspective, I assure you. If such a method of ascension truly existed, my kind would have discovered it a long time ago.

But besides, if it really did exist, I doubt you would be able to make use of it considering your... peculiar habits.
