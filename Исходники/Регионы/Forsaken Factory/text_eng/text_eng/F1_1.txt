Interesting! 

This appears to be a weather report from one of Production Facility 5F1â€™s weather nodes. 

It reports a much higher level of precipitation then normal. 

It also seems to suggest that the relatively recent<LINE>increase in rainfall has damaged part of the weather node network.
