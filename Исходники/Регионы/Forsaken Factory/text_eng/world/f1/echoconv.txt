What is a little creature like you doing all the way down here?

Looking for something?

Hundreds of cycles I spent, searching through these endless caverns, looking for something, and never finding it...

They told me if I found it I would be free...

And then, I was free...

yet I am here. as if I was always meant to stay here, stuck until I find what I am looking for

I wonder if they forgave us for leaving them
