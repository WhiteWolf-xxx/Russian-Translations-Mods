This pearl details several workers' accounts from both on and off the job.<LINE>It's pretty long, but I'll read them all in order for simplicity's sake.

"Nice cycle today.<LINE>Ten Lillies took some time off, but I still found her waiting for me in the usual spot when I got off my shift."

"Lost it all gambling again. Looks like no food for another few cycles!<LINE>(If I'm lucky the starvation will kill me quickly and save us all some trouble)"

"What was the next step?<LINE>'Once you've reached the appropriate temperature, set the machine to 24.M to begin the infusion process.'<LINE>Y'know, I've always wondered about that line - what are we infusing these things with anyway?"

"There was something I needed to do this cycle, but for some reason, I can't remember what it was.<LINE>It seems as if everyone has been forgetting stuff lately.<LINE>Endless Tides getting lost in the tunnels... Four Pillars of Ash going to work in the wrong sector...<LINE>What is going on around here?"

This next entry is just a very roundabout way of telling someone to 'Go drink Void Fluid'<LINE>...<LINE>...I can't tell if that's an insult or not...

"Too many customers and not enough time.<LINE>This one to the East District... this one to the North...<LINE>We haven't had any orders from the Temple lately.<LINE>Well, I guess they already have everything they need over there..."

"We were expanding into the cave system when we came across a group of arthropods guarding their nest.<LINE>They killed a few of the workers and we had to flee - now production will take even longer until we get those workers back.<LINE>I'm worried the boss is going to shut the expansion down completely at this point..."

"Time is a precious thing.<LINE>Regardless of how many cycles we stay in this world, it's pointless if we don't spend that time gathering the memories that represent our Real Selves.<LINE>To lose what we've gathered, in this regard, would mean to become nothing more than a worthless, empty shell."

"The heat levels are too low? Yes, we'll raise them immediately.<LINE>I'm telling you, those orders came directly from the boss!<LINE>...What do you mean, he had us do the same thing just last cycle?"

"It's dark in here.<LINE>I keep hearing strange noises, but the people are walking around as if nothing is wrong.<LINE>They gave me some tools back there and told me to get to work, but I have no idea what they're talking about."

"I need to get out of here-"
