Let's see now...

Oh! Well here's something I haven't read in quite a while.

It's a poem.<LINE>Judging by the quality of the pearl, I'm guessing it was written a very, very long time ago.

Here, let me translate for you:

"Oh Fallen Star and Longing Sky<LINE>When Dust you left behind<LINE>Came crashing through the Veil of Light<LINE>The Patterns of your Mind"

"From Creatures Born and Creatures Gone<LINE>Awoken by your Voice<LINE>Old Flames that trickle through All Time<LINE>Bereft of further Choice"

"But aching Freedom sought to Keep<LINE>By Tunnel-mark and Rain<LINE>With nothing left to push us through<LINE>And nothing left to Gain"

"Before each End you Hope for more<LINE>Through Life and Past gone by<LINE>Believe us now to reach each Step<LINE>Of Vicious Star and Sky"
