Oh, this pearl is very special! A major portion of it is encrypted, but it also contains sections of plain text.

The language used in it is very different from the ones generally used in the group...

It looks like it's written in the dialect of a pre-iterator settlement; particularly a community secluded on an island that was south-east of my complex.

This is a surprising find. The language was thought to be extinct!<LINE>For all we're both concerned, this might as well be the last trace of their dialect. 

Let me try and translate it for you.

...

Ah. These are the usual thanks and prayers accompanying deliveries from an agricultural site to a residential center.<LINE>In this case it was an inventory of moss infusions, heading to the island's capital. 

These infusions were used as an alternative to herbal tea, for ritualistic starvation.

I don't really understand why you would need to encrypt this kind of data.

Unfortunately, I do not have the computational power to unlock the rest of the pearl content. I'm sorry, little one.
