NM: It must still be considered. Entropic decay of qualitic-abstrata is already a well studied field.
BA: You're missing my point, well studied does not mean we have found everything there is to find.
PW: That is true, but you would be sifting the dust bin for loose pebbles. It's hardly worth the time.
BA: That's why I'm considering it in the first place, do we know if we have really explored all possibilities?
BA: Consider 9th order resonance, it wasn't until deep extrapolation simulations by Eternal Tides that we<LINE>fully understood its significance in bilateral systems theory.
NM: You do have a point. Just don't spend so much time chasing an assumption that you crumble to rust before you finish.
BA: Ahah, I understand your worry. I worry the same about Lessons Over Pale Water's "pet" project... 
PW: What is there to worry about? They keep me good company, even if it's just watching the wildlife.
BA: You've been getting a bit attached.
