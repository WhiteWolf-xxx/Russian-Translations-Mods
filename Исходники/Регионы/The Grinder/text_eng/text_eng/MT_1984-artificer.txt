Interesting. This is an intake, processing and upkeep log for a major sector of the metallurgy treatment unit. 

The records indicate that the machines restarted properly, and that refinery has been going smoothly since.

This is very good news.

I'm sure you've noticed the damage on my structure, although it may not make much sense to a beast like you.

This facility will allow me to repair that damage, and it's good to know everything is going well.

Thank you.
