Little creature... I am astounded you have survived to bring this to me.

This pearl is a machine operating log for the metallurgy treatment facility.

This area is incredibly dangerous: the grinders can crush practically anything.

I've lost multiple overseers in there!

The contents of the pearl are meaningless,<LINE>just information about the condition of the machines in a certain area.

I'm not surprised it's still functioning: maybe Five Pebbles wants to use it for something...?

Regardless, please don't return there! There's nothing else of interest, and it's no place of honour.
