Oh! This is curious.

This is an operating log for the metallurgy treatment facility.

Ordinarily I'd urge you not to go there,<LINE> but this log indicates it's long since broken down and ceased operations, so it's safe.

Once, Five Pebbles used this facility to attempt to rebuild parts of his structure.

His efforts - and in the end, everyone else's - were in vain,<LINE> but it's resulted in mass amounts of high-quality processed metals sitting around in there.

They're probably rather protected from the elements too.

I imagine the scavengers are making very good use out of it!
