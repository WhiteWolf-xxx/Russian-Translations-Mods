This pearl is very badly damaged.<LINE>I don't know where you found it but the surface is covered by gravings. 

Not much is readable, except for some text data.<LINE>Let me see.

Ah, yes. Another administrative poem. How exciting.

... Wait.

I remember this one.

It is a formal complaint of a void fluid engineer to a district council of my city.

My citizens found out I was trying to access void fluid from one of their distillation columns. 

Of course they did nothing about it! They were so dependent on me and my care...

I used a complex algorithm to pump just the right amount to remain unnoticed.<LINE>I don't feel like explaining it to some rodent like you, but this was actually quite brilliant.

I was so close to reach it. I became imprudent.

I went too fast and made an error in the distillate concentration.<LINE>The pipes of my interfacial processing strata broke, causing the structures above it to lose their structural integrity, and crumble.

Some of my residents lost their lives this day, but to be honest this wasn't pleasant for me neither.

Anyway, this caused some turmoil in the local group. My city councils demanded to remove all traces of void fluid from my circuits.

This was a big setback for me.

...

I'd rather not continue, it only brings back up bad memories, leave me alone now.

And take this pearl with you.
