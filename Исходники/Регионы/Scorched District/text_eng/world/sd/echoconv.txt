Oh, what have we here?

Join me in my contemplation, curious creature.

Can you see the dust flowing through the ruins beneath, like blood in arteries?

We lived here. These were our homes, streets crowded by people, filled with laughs and whispers.
Now all thats left is storms and sorrow.

I can still hear their voice, like ghosts in the static. I miss them.

Did they make it ? Are they lost inbetween, just like me?
