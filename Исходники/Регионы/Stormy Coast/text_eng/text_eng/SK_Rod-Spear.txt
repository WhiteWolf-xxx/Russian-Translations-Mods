It's an automatically generated weather report. It appears to have originated from a nearby storm nullification beacon.

There's nothing of note in the report, however. As always, the area is covered in a thick blanket of fog.

You may be surprised to find out that fog wasn't always there. Before my construction, the port where this beacon is located was apparently quite sunny.<LINE>However, the way I was constructed resulted in the port being directly in the way of my largest vapor output system.

I suppose if I lowered the output of the system, the area would return to being sunny.<LINE>On the other hand, if I raised the system's output, the port would doubtlessly become flooded with vapor.

Right now, however, I have more pressing issues to deal with than the surrounding climate.<LINE>Still, the sheer volume of water in the area...

Thank you for this pearl little creature. It has given me a valuable insight.
