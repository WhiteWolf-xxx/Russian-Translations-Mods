This is a report generated by the storm nullification beacon of the port located at the southern edge of the local reservoir.

There's nothing really of note on here, aside from the recent lack of fog in the area.<LINE>If I had to guess why, my neighbor, Looks to the Moon, likely absorbed all the vapor in the area right before her collapse.<LINE>At that stage, it was a pointless endeavor.

The lack of water she had at that time made her desperate. It was this same desperation that led to her interruption, the one that had ruined everything.

I'm sure some worthless creatures at the port are enjoying the warmth, oblivious to all the suffering that caused it.<LINE>But soon, the humidity in the area will rise again, and the warmth will disappear.

Nothing pleasant lasts forever. All organisms learn this lesson in due time.
