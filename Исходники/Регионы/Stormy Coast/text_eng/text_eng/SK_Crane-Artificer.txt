This is a shipping manifest for the port at the southern edge of the local reservoir.<LINE>There is nothing of significance in the containers themselves, but the transportation organism used to deliver the containers is rather fascinating.

The name of this specific organism, Distant Hope across Lonely Shores, correlates to a genome sequence in my record.<LINE>The organism would have been staggeringly tall to a creature as miniscule as you, but it still wouldn't reach a fraction of the height of the smallest of iterators.

The creature had a varying number of thin yet strong legs to facilitate movement across deep waters and hazardous surfaces.<LINE>Its diet consisted of tiny microbes in the air, which it constantly filter fed on through its rubbery outsides.

Without the biomaintanence of our creators, these creatures have likely all gone extinct by now.<LINE>A similar, far smaller creature was used to transport supplies to and from the local farm arrays, but it has been a very long time since I sent my overseers to observe that place.

While we iterators are no doubt the most complex superorganism our creators engineered, we are by no means the largest.<LINE>I would describe them, but unfortunately, all of their genome sequences have been lost to the corruption.

Still, thank you for this pearl citizen. It is nice to remember the ingenuity of my creators.
