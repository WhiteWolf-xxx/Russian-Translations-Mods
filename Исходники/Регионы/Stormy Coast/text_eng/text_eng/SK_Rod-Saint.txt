This pearl hasn't escaped the damages of the time. Almost all of the data is gone, aside from the very latest report.<LINE>I will read what I can make out.

"WARNING. HAZARDOUSLY LOW TEMPERATURES DETECTED. SENDING EMERGENCY REPORT TO CLOSEST ITERATOR."

"ERROR. ITERATOR COMMUNICATION BEACON HAS CRITICAL DAMAGE. UNABLE TO SEND REPORT. SEARCHING FOR NEAREST OPERATIONAL ITERATOR"

"SEARCHING"

"SEARCHING"

"SEARCHING"

This repeats until the data becomes unreadable. I sometimes wonder if any other iterators are still functioning out there.<LINE>Despite my restored functions, I have had no success in reaching them.

Perhaps it is for the best.
