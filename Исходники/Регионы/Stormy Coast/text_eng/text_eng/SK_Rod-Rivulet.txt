It's an automatically generated weather report. It appears to have originated from a nearby storm nullification beacon.

According to the report, the area has been experiencing nonstop rain for countless cycles.<LINE>While the recent downpours have become very frequent, they still aren't constant like the rain surrounding the beacon.

I can't imagine the reason for this anomaly...<LINE>Unless...

During the last moments before my collapse, I did anything I could to gain water.<LINE>I maxed out the power of my groundwater pumps, broke the limitations of my vapor intakes.<LINE>However, it was too little, too late.

Yet, the data from this pearl indicates that some parts of my water systems may still be in overdrive.<LINE>Endlessly intaking vast amounts of water from the reservoir, and outputting it as a nonstop river of vapor, flowing directly over the beacon.

The frequent downpours as of late have likely combined with the vapor river to form an even heavier storm.<LINE>The area where you found this pearl will likely be completely submerged underwater before long.

Though, for a creature like yourself, I doubt that will be much of a problem.
