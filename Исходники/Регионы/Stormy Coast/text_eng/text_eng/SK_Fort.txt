It is a program that generates various poems through random sequencing of the same lines.<LINE>This randomization occurs every time the pearl is accessed.

While some of our creators valued repetition in all things, others viewed constant change as a key to escape the cycle.<LINE>It was likely one of these change-obsessed individuals that created this poem randomizer.

As for the poem itself, I will read to you the version I witnessed first.

"An endless cycle"

"Above a black sea"

"Existence a trifle"

"We wish to be free"

Ironically, no matter how you swap the order of the lines, the meaning of the poem remains the same.
