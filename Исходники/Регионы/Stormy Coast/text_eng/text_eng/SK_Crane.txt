Ah, it's a shipping manifest from the nearby port on the southern edge of the reservoir.<LINE> It describes the contents of the containers that had arrived that day, though with quite a lengthy introduction.<LINE>I can read it out to you.

"As of this (ever so misty and serene) day, the great cargo transportation organism known as Distant Hope across Lonely Shores has returned to our great port bearing valuable goods and highly coveted objects."

"After raising our cargo acquisition machine to its maximum height, we were able to bring down the sacred containers from the belly-harness of the organism and add them to our ever-growing collection."

"The blessed contents of the first container include seventy-nine data storage spheres, thirteen exotic bone masks, two whistling organism boxes, and three inverse projectors."

The rest of the manifest describes the contents of the other two-hundred and nine containers.<LINE>Strangly, every remaining container had nothing but different varieties of gravel.

I'm not sure what purpose the gravel was for. Or why there were so many varieties. Or what even separates one variety of gravel from another?

I doubt the answers to these questions matter anymore.
