I am sorry, but this pearl is completely blank. Interestingly, it is covered in a thick layer of a paint-like substance made from...crushed insects?

Perhaps the reason for the paint is that some scavengers prefer pearls that have color, even if it makes no difference to the data inside.<LINE>The wear on the surface makes it apparent that this pearl has traded many hands since it was painted, which supports this idea.

I wonder how a scavenger would react if it found out a colored pearl it had traded for was a fake.<LINE> I am sure it would cause quite a stir, though I am never fully sure what to expect from those curious creatures.
