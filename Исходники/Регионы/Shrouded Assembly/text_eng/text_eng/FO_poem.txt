This is a collection of documentary poems written by the notable wanderer poet Enli.

The style is a hallmark of the era just after the Void Fluid revolution - <LINE>there was such possibility in the atmosphere at that time.

This collection deals with Enliâ€™s descent into an industrial disaster site:<LINE> a place of much intrigue for both religious and scientific interests.

There are two entries are of note here: in the first, beautiful prose illuminates the nature of the site:<LINE> a grand crater which seems to preternaturally accumulate airborne moisture.

The second passage details processions of water droplets held on the backs of shimmering figures.

It is unknown whether this is metaphor or truth,<LINE> as documentary poems were known for their masterful blending of fact and fiction.

Still, it is interesting!
