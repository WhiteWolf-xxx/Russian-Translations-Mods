This one is quite dusty... let me take a closer look.

It looks like some sort of diagram for a distribution of Gas Exchange Systems-<LINE> mostly composed of tubes and Bronchial strands.

They extract small pockets of water that flow underground, and the "residual" life  that emerges there.

The water is diffused out as steam above ground, and through various methods of mindstate-harvest and haze induction,<LINE> basic energy can be sapped through the emergent life.

It's a rudimentary method of energy production, but eventually it gave way to what carved the base of the Void Fluid revolution. 

It makes me rather squeemish to think the water I molder in can harbor "residual life",<LINE> so I would prefer we move on from this topic, little creature.
