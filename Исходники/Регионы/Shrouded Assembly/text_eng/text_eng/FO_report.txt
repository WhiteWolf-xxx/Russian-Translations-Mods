This looks to be a collation and analysis of around ten thousand distinct equipment manifests alongside a highly detailed map of where they happened.

The style of this report, and the format in which it is delivered places it before the Great Revolution.<LINE> This was likely produced in response to a large-scale systems failure.

The first systems to send inoperable reports are the drills at the foot of the facility,<LINE> which reported almost immediately ceased function within the drillheads completion of a standard fracking routine.

Several recurring aspects within the manifests are failure to respond, sudden and almost unexplainable degradation;<LINE> as if hundreds of cycles worth of damage simply occurred at once, and system positioning mismatch, almost entirely vertically.

I wonder- what could they have come into contact with to cause this?
