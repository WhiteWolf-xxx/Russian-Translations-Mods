Itâ€™s a moment of qualia, or a quale. 

Someone is perched above a sea of clouds, the sun just below the horizon.<LINE> They're still, but their robes stretch far far below, I can't see the bottom.

The whole thing seems to be covered with an air of melancholy, and a deep seated discomfort.<LINE> The feeling of rough round stones beneath the feet, bugs writhing underneath.

It's rather low quality, possibly made in a trance or semi-conscious state.<LINE> I wonder who it's transcriber is?
