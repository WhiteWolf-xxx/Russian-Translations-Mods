(White,Yellow,Gourmand,Red,Spear,Artificer,Rivulet)Ah! You!

(White,Yellow,Gourmand,Red,Spear,Artificer,Rivulet)Drawn in by the clarion call of the deep? <LINE> Eating up out very senses, that great sea of fog.

(White,Yellow,Gourmand,Red,Spear,Artificer,Rivulet)Buzzing, aching, a million invisible lives around us. <LINE> It entranced me so!

(White,Yellow,Gourmand,Red,Spear,Artificer,Rivulet)and here we stand, at the edge of it all. <LINE> Donâ€™t make the same mistake I did!

(White,Yellow,Gourmand,Red,Spear,Artificer,Rivulet)Go! and seek out what I never could!

(Saint)Oh. You?<LINE> Pulled from the deep again?

(Saint)Ha ha.

(Saint)This repetitive trance never ceases to amuse.

(Saint)Back down you go, making the same mistakes again.

(Saint)By chance- could this be the last time?<LINE> I doubt it.

(Saint)And inside yourself, I imagine you do too.
