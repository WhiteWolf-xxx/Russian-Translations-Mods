Oh, this one is slightly cracked.

I should still be able to read it. Let me see...

It contains an artist's depiction of the local embankment before it entered its current state.

My creators weren't around when it was constructed. I can only guess as to its purpose, beyond the obvious.

Perhaps it was used to generate electricity? Sadly, there's not much to go on.

Anyway... the drawings show lush grasslands and dense forests - far removed from the ashen crags you see today.

My intake systems draw equally from nearby sources; I imagine increased consumption would devastate areas with a low water table.

It may seem a bit of a mystery that such places could exist - and in such close proximity us - considering our vapor output. 

In reality, prevailing wind patterns direct rainfall to areas higher in elevation, creating a sort of rain shadow. Life in these "shadows" would not be pleasant.

This may have been one of the earliest pearls used to store information. You are quite lucky to have found it.
