This pearl is damaged which is strange considering just how durable pearls are, it’s part of the appeal of the medium.

Hmm…

Anyway, the pearl contains an art piece of some kind of embankment overgrown with plantlife.

I have no idea if this is supposed to be a specific place or not.

I’m refactoring it as we speak to see if I can access more and

...

It worked!

It has more artwork, all of it being of the same place and usually featuring a dam.

I wonder what that dam is for seeing as the place doesn’t look like it’s missing on water, maybe collecting excess of it for agriculture?

I also wonder why the artist made so many pieces of this one place;<LINE>these are either not signed or that information got lost when the pearl cracked so it’s impossible to know.

Well one thing’s for sure - this is a surprisingly interesting pearl!
