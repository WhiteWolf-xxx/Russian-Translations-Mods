The crack has lowered their quality by a significant amount.The facilities in this region outdate Looks to the Moon. Whatever purpose they served has long since been lost to time, much like many other areas around my facility grounds.Allocating resources to answer such curiosities would be a waste of my already limited time and energy, alongside the fact that I do not care.Although to satisfy your curiosity... I can theorise that due to the presence of a large groundwater retention dam within this region that it may have once been used to monitor and control the water level to prevent the ground beneathe our cans from turning into a thick slurry. thus slowly sinking our facilities down into the ground.This may have been one of the many hurdles our creators had to overcome when building two iterators so close together. Even our own ground rejected such a concept.
