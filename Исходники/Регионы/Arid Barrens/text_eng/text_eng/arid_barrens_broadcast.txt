[RECORDED BROADCAST : 1647.625] - PRIVATE Chasing Wind, Unparalleled Innocence

CW: Have you read the new research report No Significant Harassment published?

UI: No, what is it about?

CW: It's a systematic review on the Rot.

UI: I’d rather not talk about it then; that… thing… terrifies me.

UI: It’s such a nasty way to go.

CW: Well, at the very least it’s a reason to keep your head on your shoulders, you don't wanna do something rash and end up with an out of control gray goo of your own making.

UI: Easier said than done, the reason it even exists is because a lot of us can’t handle an eternity of nothing but research on the same topic.

CW: It may not be fair but we do have a responsibility towards the rest of the world.

CW: If we fail and let madness take us, who is going to elevate it?
