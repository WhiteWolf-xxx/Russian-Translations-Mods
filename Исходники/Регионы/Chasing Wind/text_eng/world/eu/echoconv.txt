How sad! How tragic!
An island of bones and debris, and we refused to add our own?
Why reject everything that saw us born and prosper.
We should have shown deeper humility and guided our descendants.
This sudden departure doomed this world.
Look at you, still suffering the cycles one after the other. We failed.
