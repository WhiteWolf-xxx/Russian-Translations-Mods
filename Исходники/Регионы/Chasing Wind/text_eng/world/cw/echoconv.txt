Oh? You are far from home, little friend.Tell me, what do you seek up here? For there is nothing of worth above the clouds. We built toward the sky, foolishly forgetting the answer was buried deep within the earth.Below lies the ultimate truth. Above awaits a domain full of lies.I believed in them, once. Now I linger here, basking in regrets.
