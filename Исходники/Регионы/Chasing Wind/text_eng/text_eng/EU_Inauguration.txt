This is a cordial message inviting anyone who reads it to the inauguration of Chasing Wind.

It was a very popular event among our benefactors, even compared to previous inaugurations.

It must be said that the organizers had a sense of spectacle!<LINE>Nothing had been spared to please the delegations.

It seems that some who made the trip came from across the ocean.<LINE>Perhaps citizens of a completely different group of iterators?

Although many shared a certain spirituality, you must understand that our benefactors were a diverse group with many cultures and divergent opinions.

Succeeding in bringing them together in such a way was deemed impossible by many!
