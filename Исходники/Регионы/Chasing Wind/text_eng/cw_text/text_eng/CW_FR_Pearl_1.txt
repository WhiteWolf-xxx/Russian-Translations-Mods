This is a very old exploration report of the caldera at the center of this island.

If I refer to the old archives my Benefactors gifted me, this place was not always surrounded by water.

All the vapor from us iterators warmed the nearby mountain glaciers and caused melted ice to fill the lower lands. The heavy rains did the rest.

I don't know if such vast liquid expanses existed before my construction, but I do observe there are no landmasses south and east within the range of my overseers now.

I do wonder what kind of marvels could hide below... Probably just more ruins.
