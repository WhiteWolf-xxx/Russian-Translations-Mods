This is a solemn warning from an engineer to one district of Pebbles’ city.

They noticed an abnormal series of malfunctions in a Distillation Column, huge towers used to separate Void Fluid from impurities.

If my archives are correct, it caused a major incident resulting in the death of several of our Benefactors.

They stopped bringing Void Fluid up here after that. In result, none of the most recent models like me were designed to handle its corrosiveness.

This gave some younger Sliverists very wild ideas. One of them entered an anonymous chat declaring they were going to drill a hole to the Void Sea!

...

I haven’t received any news from them in a while, now that I think about it.
