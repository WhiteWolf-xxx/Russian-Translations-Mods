This is an invitation to a light show, a way to inaugurate the end of my construction!
The event took place under my structure, in a large committee composed of the most influential citizens of the island, and numerous delegations from abroad.
Some had expressed the whim to attend aboard their luxury watercrafts.
A canal was then dug to allow them privileged access from the ocean.
The party was memorable and it is said that the celebrations were visible from everywhere in the local group.
The canal, poorly constructed, slowly eroded and transformed into a cove.
And since the bioluminescence has now become omnipresent in the shadow of my structure,<LINE>I get to remember my first moments every time I want to observe local life.
