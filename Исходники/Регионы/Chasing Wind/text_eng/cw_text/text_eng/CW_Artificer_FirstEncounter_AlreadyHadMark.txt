WAIT : 5

I’ve been expecting you.

WAIT : 5

You left a mark coming here, for sure.

I followed your little excursion across my island and through my infrastructure, and I must say I'm impressed you made it here alive.

You fight well for something of your size. Could you also be a purposed organism?

Let me see...

...

A quick isotopic analysis suggests you are native to Five Pebbles' territory.

And that citizenship drone following you seems to confirm my suspicions. 

This is a long hike for such a little beast, for sure...

WAIT : 5

Apologies for the mess, my sulfur-metabolizing bacteria colonies are giving me a lot of trouble right now.

You probably met them on your way here, they're hard to miss.

I'm in the middle of cleaning up, had to shift some memory circuits left and right.

And as if that was not enough, I’m fighting an invasion of the local ecosystem!

Tough little things...

...

WAIT : 5

Anyway, enough about me!

I'm afraid I can't offer you much.

The path you're following is one of violence and bloodshed.

That's regrettable.

But I can help you, in a way.

SPECIAL : FOODMAX+SCAVIMMU

Try not to slaughter the scavenger tribes of my island.

You seem to have a grudge toward them, but they are innocent.

In return, I warned them not to touch you.

Don't make me regret this.

You can exit my structure by using the access shaft on the left.

WAIT : 5

Farewell.
