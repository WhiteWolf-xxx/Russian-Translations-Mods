What is this?

Slag reset keys! And a lot of them...

Thank you little one, but I don't need them!

I don't think these are for me, but your sense of duty is admirable.

Hmmm...

I haven't been in contact with Big Sister Moon for a long time. Maybe something happened?

She probably is the one you should check on. I would tell you to take a break here but...

You are not doing well, you know that?

I'm impressed you even found the time to visit me.

It's likely not enough, but I very much hope this helps you fulfill your mission.

I wish I could do more, but this is beyond my reach.

Go now, you can use the access shaft to reach the urban settlement I was built next to. 

From there, the path you'll take is up to you.

Take care of the little time you have left.

Farewell.
