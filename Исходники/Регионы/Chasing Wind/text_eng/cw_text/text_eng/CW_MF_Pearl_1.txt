Where did you get that pearl? Did you rummage through my superstructure to find this?

Oh never mind, it was probably stolen by scavengers. They often come here to find pearls with fresh lattices.

Their raids are sometimes annoying but... who I am to stop the blossoming of a whole civilization?

Anyway, back on the subject.

This is an encrypted discussion between one of my peers and me.

I trust you not to spread the word around, but I have some Sliverist... tendencies.

Our little group believes breaking the taboo of self-destruction is the solution to the Great Problem.

But you see, curious creature, not every iterator has the same view on what happened to our dear Sliver of Straw.

The pearl you brought me is an extract of the log of an anonymous chat. Why hide, you ask?

Well, these discussions should not be spread around carelessly. There are some dangerous ideas here I hope are never put in practice.

But some Sliverists I spoke with are particularly... stubborn. They will do anything to achieve their goal.

Now that I think about it, archiving such conversations was probably a bad idea.

Could you get rid of it for me, please?
