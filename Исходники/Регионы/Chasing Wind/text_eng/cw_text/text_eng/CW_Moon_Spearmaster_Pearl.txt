Oh... this pearl is very familiar to me.

This is a private message from Seven Red Suns, destined for Five Pebbles' chamber.

We were once quite close to one another, before deciding to follow our own paths.

We could not agree on the best way to resolve the Great Task.

Seven Red Suns and I spoke about the content of this pearl in great detail before ultimately sending it.

Despite our differences, we agreed that it was quite important to find the right words...

If you stand here in my chamber with this pearl in your hands, then it must have already reached its recipient.

I really hope for all our sakes that he understood the intent of it.

You must understand that you have delivered an extremely important message; the eyes of the entire local group are on you at the moment.

...

I will contact your creator as soon as delays allow; my communication modules haven't been the most reliable.

...

I previously told you of a way to put an end to your struggles for good, though I have another request first.

Could you make one more journey and check the status of Looks to the Moon for me?

Many iterators are more than worried about her wellbeing, myself included.

...

Thank you, brave messenger.
