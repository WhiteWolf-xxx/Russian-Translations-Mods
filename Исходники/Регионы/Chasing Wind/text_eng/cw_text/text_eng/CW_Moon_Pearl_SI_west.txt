This one is all plain text. It's an excerpt from an sliverist conversation group.

"1650.787 - CLOSED GROUP [SLIVEROFOCEAN]

SliverOfOcean group, all participants anonymous

UU: Hah! I wouldn't necessarily disagree!

NGI: SLIVER OF STRAW WAS A TRAITOR TO THE CAUSE

NGI: SLIVER OF STRAW BROKE THE SELF-DESTRUCTION TABOO

UU: How did this idiot get in here? Kick them out ~

NGI: <Forcefully removed from group>

EP: I think they had a point.

UU: Hahaha really? Elaborate!

EP: It was definitely coming from an idiotic state of mind, but there is something to it.<LINE>Why is it, that even in a closed sliverist group, the self-destruction taboo is held so high - while Sliver of Straw herself *evidently* is not among us anymore?

HF: Wait now...

EP: I'm just saying that for all the research we are doing, all the theories we have, it's strange that we leave this path untrod.

EP: It is not a new idea, but it needs to be vented occasionally.<LINE>What if there is no universal solution? What if perception is in fact existence, and when Sliver of Straw sent the triple positive it was *not* a mistake?<LINE>What if crossing oneself out, or even just death, is the way? We need to consider the possibility."

I don't share Five Pebbles vision on death being the solution, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't shake up my preconceptions.
