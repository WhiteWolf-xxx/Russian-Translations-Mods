It's the blueprint for a Void Fluid filtration system. Do you know what Void Fluid is? You seem to be a very curious traveler, maybe you've visited the nearby caldera.

Well what you might have seen here is Living Rock, an impure solution of Void Fluid and melted rock.

Void Fluid in its purest natural form is found deep beneath the crust, below the oldest ruins.

Some thought the Living Rock wellspring at the center of the island could lead to what is called the Void Sea.

But none returned to tell the tale, so the extraction was limited to the surface level of the caldera.

Railways were built to transport Living Rock for distillation. This was before Void Fluid filtration systems were discovered and made Living Rock obsolete.

Pure Void Fluid was then available pretty much everywhere, and Living Rock became a mere curiosity.
