Oh? What is this? A public announcement to the local group...

"1654.110 - PUBLIC

Big Sis Moon to Local Group

BSM: Two cycles ago, my neighbor Five Pebbles drastically increased his water consumption to four times the normal amount.<LINE>He has been unresponsive for a period of time longer than that. The two of us share groundwater, and I have been without water for almost a cycle.

BSM: Any attempts at communication have been met with complete silence, and my situation is becoming increasingly dangerous.

BSM: I ask the local group for information about when you were last able to contact him, and to try to use those same communication channels again, repeatedly until you get a response.<LINE>I will be clear on this - if he is not persuaded to stop whatever it is he's doing, I will die.

BSM: Before that happens, I will utilize my seniority privilege and use forced communications, hoping to shake him out of it.<LINE>Forced communications in the network will be unpleasant for all, and I will wait as long as possible before I turn to that option."

This is the first time I read this. This is highly concerning. No wonder I can't contact her.

I'll see what I can do. Thanks for showing me this, little one.
