Interesting... This one could have been written by me, but it's not mine.

There are some dangerous ideas in here.

You see, we Sliverists are obviously fascinated by the disapperance of our dear Sliver of Straw. But not everyone dares to challenge the taboos we were born with.

Some of us are just... morbidly curious. Others, like me, think it is still possible to find a triple affirmative while working within the frame of taboos.

I believe there might be more subtle solutions to self-destruction aside from the ones most other Sliverists might consider. What if we had to die... in a certain way?

If we did something wrong, would we just be brought back here? Maybe in a different form?

This terrifies me.

But that is not what this pearl contains. This was written by Seven Red Suns for one of their friends.

It was a promising way to circumvent several taboos. I'll spare you the details, but it uses genetic alteration to pinpoint taboo loci and overwrite them.

The process has its advantages, but it has a major flaw Suns was unable to recognize when they shared this.

It is non replicable. Iterator genomes can be wildly different, and this diversity is simply impossible to predict. I don't even think we all share the same taboos, as we can't speak about them.

Of course, it could work if an individual were to alter their genome independently, but the processing toll would just be too heavy.

You would incapacitate yourself before finding how to even rewrite a single locus. And that's without even talking about managing the Rot.
