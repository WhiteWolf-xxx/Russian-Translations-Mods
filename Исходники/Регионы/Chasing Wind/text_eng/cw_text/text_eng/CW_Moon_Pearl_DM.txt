It's a large batch of personal notes and research. Very typical for what you would find in someone's memory conflux.

But this data is not familiar to me. It's about standard karmic inversion loops and other stuff.<LINE>I have long since forsaken this lead.

I think spiral-based algorithmic simulations much more interesting.<LINE>You see, such methods allow for the vectorization of discrete karmic fields into...

Into...

Alright, I understand this might not be of the greatest interest to you.

You should probably put it back where you find it, it is of no use to me.
