Greetings, curious visitor!

I followed your little excursion through my infrastructure, and I must say I'm impressed you made it here.

I couldn't resist studying you from a distance, I hope you didn't mind! I don't see your kind often here.

...

It seems one of my neighbors has already bestowed you the gift of communication! This is a surprising privilege for a small lifeform like you.

Were you sent by one of them? You don't look like a messenger. Let me see...

...

A quick isotopic analysis suggests you are native to somewhere beyond Five Pebbles territory.

This is an impressive hike for such a little beast. I guess you must have crossed the shallow waters near the retaining wall.

Well, you are here now! Welcome to my small island, a perfect place of peace and leisure!

...

I'm joking, things are only getting worse. Especially with neighbors like mine.

Your presence here is refreshing from the constant quarrels of the local group.

Please take the time to rest, you're safe here.

I have to apologize for the mess, my bacteria colonies are spewing sulfur everywhere...

You probably met them on your way here, they're hard to miss.

I'm in the middle of cleaning up, trying to contain them in my memory conflux for now.

I'm trying something new, sampling some local flora to compete for resources with my colonies.

This is a hard balance to keep, and to be honest the consequences could be catastrophic for my immune system.

But it also let me test some ... old theories I haven't yet dare to try.

...

Anyway, enough about me! 

I'm afraid I can't offer you much right now.

I believe this small gift should help you find what you seek.

You must have noticed the peculiarity of being tethered to this physical world, waking up again and again.

I sometimes wish I was a little beast like you, because you have a way out.

Follow the old path. Go to the north-west, past the overgrown farms.

Then down into the earth, where the rock boils, go as deep as you can reach.

You're resourceful, I'm sure you'll find your way.

You can exit my structure by using the access shaft on the left.

I will now resume my work, there is much to be done.
