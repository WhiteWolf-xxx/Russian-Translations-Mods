It's a production record of a mask factory, for what seems to be its last time in service. Have you seen a bone mask? I think some scavengers of my island like to wear them.

In ancient times the masks were actually about showing spiritual persuasion - covering the face as a way to symbolically abate the self.<LINE>Then of course, that was quite subverted as excessively ornate and lavish masks became an expression of identity. Some public persons did have problems with narrow doorways.

Originally monks in a temple would make the masks using bone plaster, and when the production was automated it would generally remain on the same site. So that the old stones could... radiate the material with holiness, I suppose.

This is from one such facility called Side House.<LINE>I don't know about this one but it is probably from where you come from, on Pebbles grounds.<LINE>In the iterator projects many old industrial-religious sites like this were remodeled and incorporated.<LINE>I think this one was made to provide pellets of holy ash to Pebbles, but knowing him he probably hasn't used much of it!
