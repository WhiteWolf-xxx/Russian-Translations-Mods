The lattices in this pearl have been accessed very recently.

This is fascinating. The data here consists of a singular audio track.

I have found myself collecting and archiving ancient artefacts of the time my benefactors were still roaming this land.

This would be a great asset in my collection, there is a lot to uncover here!

I have a deep feeling this memory was dear to someone, though.

I hate to say this, but you should probably bring it back where you found it.
