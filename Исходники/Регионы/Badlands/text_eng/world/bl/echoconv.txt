I sense your presence, little beast.<LINE>Join me and bear witness to the culmination of all things.

Above us hangs the remnants of civilization, covered in dust and debris.<LINE>Below us lies the endless void, slowly creeping up to consume all into nothingness.

But that time has yet to come.<LINE>For now, we may take our time to reflect.

Reflect on the world, and its cycles. On journeys made, and marvels constructed.

And then look within yourself, on bonds forged and actions taken.

We stand at our origin, yet so much has changed.<LINE>Did we lose ourselves along the way?

Nonsense! It is our nature to grow and defy the repetitions of time.

So bask in the glory of existence and consider what has yet to come!
