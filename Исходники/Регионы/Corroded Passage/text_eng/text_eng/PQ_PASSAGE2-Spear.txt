This pearl has an intricate design, most likely meant<LINE>to be an ornament or a piece of art on it's own.

There seems to be a series of musical pieces written down on it.<LINE>Music! This compositions and details seem quite old... Perhaps older than anything you've seen, including me.

I wonder, do you understand what music is?

A series of sounds that together sound pleasant to your mind, I wonder<LINE>if other organisms were capable of such expression, too!

My creators, or rather, my creators ancestors, had a good taste<LINE>for creating wonders such like this!

Conversation groups have revolved around the conservation and appreciation<LINE>of now lost and irreplaceable pieces of art and history, made in a different<LINE>era with different intent, yet, some of it having being kept through time.

I wish I could share this pearl with the local group! I'm sure someone would appreciate it.

I sadly can't translate this into audible, understandable noise. Such<LINE>treasures lost in the troubles of translation and communication...
