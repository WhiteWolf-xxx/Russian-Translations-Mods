How interesting. This pearl is truly a piece of art as a whole,<LINE>such details, such art engraved onto one single pearl...

The ancestors to our creators, who once populated this<LINE>dance are known across us iterators for their affinity at building with<LINE>such detail and thought, preparing their creations<LINE>for a future thousands of cycles beyond their own.

Even in the era where the clouds obscured the ground, and cities above giant metal cans<LINE>were now populated, the appreciation for creating things was never lost.

This pearl even seems to contain an old version of what was a<LINE>song revered in my own city. A tune that... Now almost seems nostalgic.

Thank you, I will keep this in my archives.
