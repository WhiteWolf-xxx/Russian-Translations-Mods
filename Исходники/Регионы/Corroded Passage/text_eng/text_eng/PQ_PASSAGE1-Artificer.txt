Where did you find this? This seems to be older than my own structure.

This pearl has plain text written on it. Allow me to read it to you.

"I too, like a ripe fruit, fall, fall, fall to the ground beneath.<LINE>I feel its embrace, hugging my skin, my flesh, my bones with its warmth.<LINE>I fall into my slumber. I lose myself, more, more, and more each time. <LINE>I see the light once more, but my skin, my flesh, my bones, they are left behind.

I am not the same, but I remain. Changed, renewed, not quite the same.

I look behind me, and I see my remains. I look ahead of me, and I see my own self looking back at me from above."

Quite an interesting read. It talks about the unstoppable change that comes with time itself. A cycle, in it's own way.

This will help me endure the passage of time a little better. Thank you.
