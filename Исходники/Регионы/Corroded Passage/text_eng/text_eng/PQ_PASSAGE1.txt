Where did you find this little creature? This seems to be quite old.

This pearl contains a single poem. I doubt you would find it's<LINE>actual content useful, little creature, so allow me to summarize!~

This text talks about the inevitable change<LINE>all things have, and will, go through. It makes a comparison between the writer and a fruit,<LINE>talking about the recurring cycle that they will go through.

They will go back to the ground, and from the ground, they will come back once more, but not quite the same.

After hundreds of cycles, there is barely any resemblance left of<LINE>what originally existed.
 
I suppose it may be hard to grasp just how much things change.<LINE>The world around you is a mountain of change after change, little creature! You live in the remains of a long gone past. 

...<LINE>I, too, live in the remains of my past.
