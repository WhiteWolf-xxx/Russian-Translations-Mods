FPB: Like I was saying, it's been harder to come across study material nowadays.

FPB: Supplies for my projects... I've learned the hard way to truly be as efficient as possible.<LINE>Despite our creators preparing us for their absence, the effect has been noticiable rather... quickly.

UD: That's what happens when you don't plan accordingly!~

PS: I share that feeling. How hard is it nowadays to work on new projects!

PS: Have you heard about No Significant Harassment's little project?

UD: The purposed organism? I find it quite interesting. 

PS: Likewise. I suppose it is a good way to deal with our own inevitable decay. 

UD: We could send Bones something to work on! I can think of a few things~

FPB: Oh please!

FPB: I... Like the idea. I wouldn't want to lose contact when we get rusty.
