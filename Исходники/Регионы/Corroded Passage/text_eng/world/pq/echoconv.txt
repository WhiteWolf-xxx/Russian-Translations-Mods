(Spear,Artificer)You hold a purpose.(Spear)You weren't made out of nothing.<LINE>Every part of your organism was designed with a goal in mind.(Spear)There were no random factors involved in your creation.<LINE>You exist for a reason.(Spear,Artificer)And yet... Does it make you feel any better?(Artificer)Raw anger, a cruel lust for violence.(Artificer)Does the world make you angry, too?<LINE>I always hoped that the world would change.(Artificer)I was foolish, of course, for it is an unstoppable machine.<LINE>Never changing, never ending. It existed long before us, and<LINE>it will outlive us far into a future we won't comprehend.(Spear)We come into this world wrapped in flesh and bones.<LINE>We come empty handed, and so we leave too.(Spear,Artificer)We aren't born for a reason. Our existance is meaningless,<LINE>and in the big cycle of the world, we are nothing.(Artificer)So do whatever you please. Break free from your mortal bindings, my friend.<LINE>Go after the goal that fuels your heart.(Spear)Why does anything matter, then? What are we<LINE>supposed to do within our mortality?(Spear)You cannot talk. And yet I know...(Spear)I... understand, little creature. Thank you.(X-Saint,Spear,Artificer)Why are you here, little one?(X-Saint,Spear,Artificer)What holds you tethered to this world?<LINE>Is it the comfort of your own flesh? Or the fear of letting go of it?(X-Saint,Spear,Artificer)I was once just like you. A creature stuck inside my own mortality. (X-Saint,Spear,Artificer)But I was meant to be great! I was celebrated! I created marvelous things,<LINE>greater than myself! My name was known across the land! (X-Saint,Spear,Artificer)And look at me now. Sitting cycle after cycle in this place. (X-Saint,Spear,Artificer)Forgotten, meaningless.<LINE>Just another sacrifice in it's path. (X-Saint,Spear,Artificer)Nothing mattered in the end.(Saint)In the end, I truly had no meaning.(Saint)The world won't remember me. Everything that made what<LINE>we know up is now gone. Lost to time.(Saint)And yet... That truly is everything.(Saint)We are nothing. We are<LINE>tiny specks in this great endless cycle.(Saint)But we are alive! And as long as we live,<LINE>we will forever turn nothing into something!(Saint)In the end, I truly had no meaning!<LINE>I was free to do as I pleased!(Saint)Embrace the nothingness, little one!<LINE>For you are everything!
