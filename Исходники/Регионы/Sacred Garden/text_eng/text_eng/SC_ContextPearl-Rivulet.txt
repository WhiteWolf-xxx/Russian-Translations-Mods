This is a shipment log containing information about the delivery of plants known as "Wheel Flowers"

There are many farms out there that grew these hallucinogenic plants, as these plants were very important to our creators.

These Wheel Flowers were connected to symbols of enlightenment, and so they became very important to their culture.

So when Five Pebbles was first constructed, and his construction ended blocked off the natural light that was used to grow the flora there.<LINE>It ended up making many who relied on this farm for their source of the hallucinogenic plants very displeased.

Eventually they decided to continue underground and use the surface as a way to store the plants in mass.

I wonder if Five Pebbles' increase output of water has caused the farm to complete flood, if not partly at least.
