This is a seies of shipment logs relating to hallucinogenic plants know as "Wheel Flowers" being grown on a farmstead near the citadel.

As time grew on the farm's religious meaning grew due to the Wheel Flowers religious significance,<LINE>and as a result the farm became very important to many.

Unfortunately for them, once my construction began it ended up blocking the light used to grow the plants.

This made my already controversial consturction even more divisive as they knew the meadow couldn't survive with purely artificial light,

It also didn't help that the farm was the main source of the Wheel Flower hallucinogens.

In the end, production had to be moved underground and had to be slowed,<LINE>the surface turned into a storage site for the plants.

Many were disappointed and angry at this decision, as now the holiness the meadow once had was now diminished.

Strangely enough it was still considered holy enough to enact similar defences as to what the memory crypts has.

The information on this pearl isn't data I had logged on my records,<LINE>it's useless, but nice to have.
